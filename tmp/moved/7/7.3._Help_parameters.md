## 7.3 Help parameters

Help parameters are required on a parametric curve for any coincident constraint to a point, distance dimension, tangent, normal or equal curve property constraint. 
Help parameters may also be used with ellipses if required. 
Each of these dimension types can measure to any near or far point on the curve. 
To identify which solution is required the application must supply the DCM with a help parameter whenever the Frustum function DCM\_dimension\_parameter is called. 
A help parameter is similar to a help point on a circle or ellipse. 
In each case other solutions exist and the application uses the help parameter to tell the DCM what is required.

As for help points, help parameters need only specify the initial value accurately enough to distinguish which solution is required. 
The DCM will calculate an accurate value when the model is solved. 
This can be found by calling the DCM function help\_parameter (or in some cases, equal\_distance\_help\_parameter) and will be output through the Frustum functions DCM\_dimension\_parameter\_update and DCM\_equal\_distance\_dimension\_parameter\_update.

[Figure 45: Distance dimension to parametrics](#_Ref420906600) illustrates dimensions between two points and a parametric curve. 
On the right is a distance dimension to a local near point on the parametric curve and on the left there is a distance dimension to a local far point.

### 7.3.1 Fixing help parameters

Normally, the position of the help parameter is able to "slide" along the parametric. 
In many cases this will be necessary to allow the help parameter to move in order to find a solution. 
It is also possible to specify that the DCM should not change the value of the help parameter when the model is evaluated. 
This is referred to as fixing the help parameter and will remove the degree of freedom that allows the other geometry to slide along the parametric curve. 
For example, fixing a help parameter will make it possible for an application to do the following:

- Make a point coincident with a parametric curve at a fixed parameter value.
- Make a line tangent to a parametric curve at the start of the curve.

This is done by calling the DCM function parameter\_node to create a p\_node for the help parameter, and then calling the DCM function fix on this p\_node. 
See chapter [16\. The DCM Interface](16._The_DCM_Interface.md)

Limitation: In the current version, DCM will not solve all over-rigid cases which are caused by equal value fixed p\_nodes on the same curve. 
Since it is common to wish to restrict multiple constraints to act at the same fixed position (e.g. 
a curve end) then it is necessary to work around this limitation by using equal parameter constraints and fixing only one representative p\_node at a particular value.

### 7.3.2 Equal parameter constraints

An equal parameter constraint can be added between two p\_nodes on the same parametric curve or ellipse. 
This will make the two p\_nodes identical when they are solved by the DCM. 
This constraint will not control the actual value of the parameters, although this can be done by fixing either of the p\_nodes. 
This constraint makes it possible for the application to ensure that constraints to a parametric are applied at the same place.

For example, a line which is tangent to a parametric may also cross the parametric at another point. 
By using an equal parametric constraint a point could be made coincident to the line and the parametric at the tangent point. 
Without the constraint, the point could lie at the intersection instead.

Note that if an application is using the C interface, they must use DCM\_add\_dp instead of DCM\_add\_d.

### 7.3.3 Ellipse help parameters

When applying constraints to ellipses, applications can select whether to use help points or help parameters to specify the location at which the constraint should apply. 
If the application has registered the Frustum function DCM\_ellipse\_dimension\_parameter this will be called before DCM\_dimension\_point. 
If the application returns a parameter value then the DCM will not request a help point.

If the application chooses to return help parameters for the ellipse, then it must use the same parameterisation as the DCM. 
The parameter on an ellipse t is used in the equation which defines an ellipse:

P( t ) = C \+ (R cos t)X \+ (r sin t)Y

where 0 <= t < 2Ï€, C is the ellipse centre, X and Y are unit vectors in the directions of the major and minor axis respectively, and R and r are the major and minor radii respectively.

Note that help parameters must be used on ellipses that have curve extensions (see section [7.5 Curve extensions](7.5._Curve_extensions.md)
