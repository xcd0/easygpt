## 7.1 Fixed-shape, scalable and flexible parametric curves

Spline curves, conic curves and evaluated parametric curves in the DCM can be either fixed-shape, scalable or flexible.

A fixed-shape curve can be translated and rotated by the DCM in order to solve dimensions and constraints but the DCM is not able to change its shape or size. 
However, the application is free to change the shape of the curve in between DCM calls.

A scalable curve can be translated and rotated in a similar way to a fixed-shape curve. 
It also has one or two extra degrees of freedoms which allows it to be scaled by the DCM in order to solve the model. 
Three forms of scaling are supported: A uniform, or isotropic scale; uni-scalable, where the scaling is in one direction only, with no changes perpendicular to that direction and bi-scalable, with two independent scales in perpendicular directions.

A flexible curve has internal degrees of freedoms which the DCM is able to use to solve dimensions and constraints to the curve, in addition to the freedoms from moving the curve. 
The number and type of freedoms depends on how the curve is defined, and further details are given below.
