## 7.6 Alternatives to using DCM parametric curves

Even if the application's model contains parametric curves it may not be necessary to add them into the DCM. 
For example, an application may define a curve that passes through a series of points. 
The DCM can be used to manipulate the points, and the application can then regenerate the curve. 
Provided that the application does not need to add dimensions and constraints to the spline curve there is no need to add it to the DCM.

In another example, two bounded lines can be used to construct a cubic curve. 
The ends of the bounded lines are used for the start and end point of the cubic, and their direction gives the tangent direction at these points. 
The DCM can be used to control the position of the bounded lines, and then the cubic curve can be recalculated by the application. 
The cubic curve need not be added to the DCM.

Generally, these methods are only possible in cases where dimensions and constraints will not be added to the parametric curve. 
If this is required, then the curve must be added to the DCM model as described above.
