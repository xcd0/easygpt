## 7.5 Curve extensions

Curve extensions are additional regions of parameterised curves which can be added to the ends of parametric geometry. 
These extensions can be added at the original curve ends or, for offset curves and ellipses, at positions within the original parameterisation, in which case the extension replaces the rest of the original curve. 
Curve extensions may be added to evaluated parametrics, splines, conics, offset curves and ellipses. 
When a curve has been extended, then constraints to the curve may be solved in the extended regions.

In general, a curve extension can be one of two types:

- An extension beyond the parameter limits, starting on an end of the parameter range. 
This type of extension can be used for non-periodic splines, evaluated parametrics and offset curves.
- An alternate bounded curve that starts from a given parameter which may be either fixed or variable (by the application). This type of extension can only be used with offset curves and ellipses.

A typical use for a curve extension is to extend a bounded curve (such as an open spline) at its start and end. 
However, when used with periodic geometry (only supported for ellipses in this release), the effect can be to change the geometry from a periodic curve to a bounded curve, with the bounded portion being part of the original ellipse and the ends being defined by the extensions. 
[Figure 48: Curve extensions](#_Ref75159190) shows a curve extension being used to bridge a gap between the offset from a spline and an offset of a line. 
An extension (the portion of the offset between start and end) has been applied to the end of the offset curve, which is long enough to intersect with the offset of the line.

Curve extensions can be used to support the offsetting of adjacent parametric edges: If two adjacent curves in a profile do not meet tangentially, then the offset curves from these curves will not be connected in some positions. 
In this case, it is possible to use curve extensions on the offset curve to extend the curves so that they meet.

When adding curve extensions the application must specify:

- Which end of the curve is extended (one or both ends).
- For each extension, whether it starts at the end of the curve or from within the original parameter range (ellipses and offset curves only).
- For each extension, the parameters at which the extension starts and ends.
- Whether the curve extension is linear or a custom shape. 
Custom curve extensions are only supported for application parametrics. 
An additional polynomial extension type is available for bounded spline curves (see [7.5.2 Polynomial curve extensions](#_Ref404950394)).

### 7.5.1 Linear curve extensions

For linear curves, the DCM will calculate the curve shape internally. 
A linear extension is tangent to the original curve, with a constant first derivative equal to that of the curve where it begins unless the curve is an offset curve type. 
In that case, the first derivative is equal to the first derivative of the base curve at that parameter value.

### 7.5.2 Polynomial curve extensions

For non-periodic bounded spline curves defined within the DCM, it is possible to extend the curve using the existing curve definition. 
The DCM will extend a spline curve using the underlying polynomial curve that represents the original section of the spline. 
A bounded spline curve may be extended from either end of the curve, and continues until the specified extension end parameter is reached.

As for other curve extension types in the DCM, extensions are specified via DCM\_parametric\_extension\_data. 
The application must specify the extension type (DCM\_PARA\_EXT\_TYPE\_BS\_POLYNOMIAL) and to which end of the curve the extension should be added (DCM\_PARA\_EXT\_END\_MIN or DCM\_PARA\_EXT\_END\_MAX).

Note that polynomial curve extensions may only be created from the end of the original parameter range (by specifying an extension start type of DCM\_PARA\_EXT\_START\_TYPE\_END). Other extension start types (which define an alternate bounded curve within the parameter space of the existing curve) are only supported for offset curves and ellipses.

Use of polynomial curve extensions is not recommended with flexible rational b-spline curves (i.e. 
where values of weights other than 1 are used for the control points) since the stability of solutions to points on the extensions is usually not satisfactory in these cases.

### 7.5.3 Custom curve extensions

For custom curves, the application provides an evaluator to define the shape of the curve in the same way as for an evaluated parametric. 
Discontinuities in tangent magnitude or direction are not supported on custom curve extensions in this release, except at the join between the extension and the original curve, where a tangent magnitude discontinuity is allowed. 
There is a separate Frustum function for the evaluators of parametric extensions. 
Note that the evaluator function for g\_nodes of the type DCM\_PARAMETRIC will never be called for an extension. 
Thus, if a curve extension is defined such that it overrides some of the original parameter range, the DCM will call DCM\_parametric\_extension\_evaluator if it requires a position on the extension, and DCM\_parametric\_evaluator if it requires a position on the original curve at that parameter value.

Note that if an offset curve is generated using a curve with extensions as the base curve, then the extensions will be ignored and the offset curve will be defined only for the original parameter range of the base curve. 
If there is more than one offset curve that is defined in terms of a single base curve, then any extensions on these offset curves and base curves are independent and must be defined independently.
