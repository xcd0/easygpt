## 7.4 Constraints to curves with geometric discontinuities

It is possible to find solutions that measure exactly onto the discontinuity of a spline or evaluated parametric.

For example, a point that has a distance dimension to a G1 discontinuity can lie anywhere on an arc centred on the discontinuity. 
[Figure 46 : Distance dimension to a discontinuous curve](#_Ref91307169) shows a point dimensioned to a discontinuous parametric curve. 
The dotted line shows the path taken by the point as it is dragged along the curve and over the discontinuity.

It is also possible to specify on which side a p\_node should lie of a discontinuity to control the solution. 
[Figure 47 : Controlling the side of a p\_node at a discontinuity](#_Ref91323490) shows a circle tangent to a parametric curve at a discontinuity.
