# 7\. Overview of parametric geometry

Geometry added to the DCM can be divided into analytic geometry (points, lines, circles and ellipses) and parametric geometry. 
Parametric geometry consists of curves that have a parameter which corresponds to a unique position along the curve.

The DCM supports parametric curves of the following types:

- Spline curves
- Conic curves
- Evaluated parametric curves

These geometry types have various properties in common. 
This section addresses the issues which arise from use of any type of parametric geometry. 
Details of how each of these types of curve can be created and used are given in the following chapters: [8\. Spline curves](8._Spline_curves.md)

Note that if a model contains multiple instances of the same parametric curve it is possible to use the copy curve type to add these more efficiently to DCM. 
See chapter [11\. Offset and copy curves](11._Offset_and_copy_curves.md)
