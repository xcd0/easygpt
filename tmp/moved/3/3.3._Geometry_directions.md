## 3.3 Geometry directions

The direction of a line, the direction of the major axis of an ellipse and the direction of an evaluated parametric curve are significant for angular dimensions and for defining the chirality. 
The direction must therefore be returned consistently by the application to the DCM and cannot be arbitrarily reversed.

The application does not need to normalise a direction vector being returned to the DCM (i.e. 
it does not need to be a unit vector). However, the length of the vector should not be zero.
