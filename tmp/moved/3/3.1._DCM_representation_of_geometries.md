## 3.1 DCM representation of geometries

[Figure 9: Geometry representations](#_Ref438009374) shows how non-spline geometries are represented by the DCM. 
Note that applications do not have to store the data with the same representation as the DCM since the information is always accessed through the Frustum routines and all the DCM ever uses is a pointer to the geometry. 
See section [15.5 Data handling](15.5._Data_handling.md)
Spline geometry support uses a slightly different method as described in chapter [8\. Spline curves](8._Spline_curves.md)

Figure 9: Geometry representations

- Point

A point is represented by the x and y co-ordinates of its position.



Frustum function: [DCM\_point\_point](17.1._Geometry_definition_functions.md)
- Line

A line is represented by a position on the line and its direction.



Frustum functions: [DCM\_line\_point](17.1._Geometry_definition_functions.md)
- Circle

A circle is represented by the centre position and its radius. 
The DCM supports circles with a zero radius or positive radius. 
It is possible to specify to the DCM that zero radius circles should be prevented, either on a global basis via a DCM option (using the set\_option function) or for individual circles via a Frustum function. 
Circles cannot have a negative radius, although the DCM can optionally invert the sense of circles to prevent a solve failure due to a requirement for a negative circle. 
See section [5.2 Circle inversion](5.2._Circle_inversion.md)



Frustum functions: [DCM\_circle\_center](17.1._Geometry_definition_functions.md)
- Ellipse

An ellipse is represented by the centre position, the direction of the major radius and its major and minor radii. 
In addition, ellipses are parameterised so that it is possible to position constraints at particular locations. 
The ellipse parameter has a period of 2π, starting from the major axis in an anti-clockwise direction.



Frustum functions [: DCM\_ellipse\_center](17.1._Geometry_definition_functions.md)
- Evaluated parametric

The DCM will enquire the following information about a parametric curve:

\- A direction defined by the application.

    \- The upper and lower parameter limits for a non-periodic curve.

    \- The parametric period for a periodic curve.

    \- The number and location of any discontinuities.

The shape of the curve is accessed through the Frustum by asking for the position and, optionally, the derivatives for a given parameter value.



Frustum functions: [DCM\_parametric\_direction](17.5._Frustum_functions_for_evaluated_parametrics.md)
- Splines

The DCM represents a spline using a NURBS definition. 
There are many different ways that the data to define a spline can be given to the DCM. 
The DCM defines a spline data structure which is used to transfer information on the spline between the application and the DCM. 
Full details of spline geometry support is given in chapter [8\. Spline curves](8._Spline_curves.md)



Frustum functions: [DCM\_spline\_update](17.4._Functions_for_spline_curves.md)
- Conic curve

The DCM conic type is a bounded region of a conic section. 
The DCM interface and behaviour for conics are similar to those for splines. 
The DCM defines a conic data structure which is used to transfer information on the conic between the application and the DCM. 
Full details can be found in chapter [10\. Conics](10._Conics.md)



Frustum functions: [DCM\_conic\_update](17.7._Frustum_functions_for_conics.md)
- Offset curve

This represents a curve that is an exact offset of a parametric or an ellipse. 
The DCM will enquire the offset distance and which side of the generating curve it lies. 
All other geometric information is derived from the generating curve. 
See chapter [11\. Offset and copy curves](11._Offset_and_copy_curves.md)



Frustum functions: [DCM\_offset\_orientation](17.8._Frustum_functions_for_offset_and_copy_curves.md)
- Copy curve

This represents a curve that is an exact copy of a parametric or offset curve but in a different location. 
The DCM will enquire the transform that maps the generating curve to this copy. 
All other geometric information is derived from the generating curve. 
See chapter [11\. Offset and copy curves](11._Offset_and_copy_curves.md)
