## 3.8 Patterns

The application may wish to constrain certain geometry to be arranged in a regular linear or rotational array. 
DCM provides both 1D and 2D pattern constraints to support this. 
These constraints are defined with relation to a pattern reference node.

Pattern constraints remove all the relative freedoms of the individual geometry and replace them with the internal freedoms of the pattern. 
1D patterns have one freedom, which is either a distance or an angle, whilst 2D patterns have two distance freedoms. 
The direction(s) or centre of a pattern is defined by reference to another DCM geometry.
