## 3.4 Rigid sets

An application may require that a collection of geometries is to be treated as though it were rigidly constrained, even though it may have few (if any) constraints or dimensions. 
This can be achieved with the DCM by the use of rigidsets. 
A rigid set can be created in the DCM, and then geometries can be added to the set. 
Any number of geometries can be added to a set, but a geometry can only be in a single set. 
It is not possible to add a set to a set.

All of the geometries in a rigid set will be kept rigid with respect to other geometries in the same set. 
The DCM will not attempt to solve any dimensions and constraints between two geometries in the same set.

A set can be positioned by applying dimensions and constraints between its geometries and the geometries in other sets, or to geometries that are not in any set.
