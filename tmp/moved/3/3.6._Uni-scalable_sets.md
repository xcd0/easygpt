## 3.6 Uni-scalable sets

The application may require a collection of geometries that can be grouped together as a set but can scale in one direction. 
This can be achieved by using a uni-scalable set. 
A uni-scalable set has the same translational and rotational freedoms as a rigid set and also has the ability to scale in one direction such that the shape is preserved, but the aspect ratio is not. 
A rectangle added to such a set, with the scaling direction parallel to its base would have the freedom to change width, but not height.

Unlike a rigid set, a uni-scalable set does not automatically have a total of three degrees of freedom. 
A scalable set instead derives its degrees of freedom from the contained geometries.

The following images show the use of a uni-scalable set. 
The horizontal dimension is in the same direction as the scaling direction, and is therefore allowed to vary as a driving dimension. 
Notice that the angle of the line inside the rectangle changes in response to the driving dimension changing.

Note that the vertical measurement of 70.0 is for reference purposes. 
If this were a dimension, then the set would be over-defined.

The only geometries that can be added to a uni-scalable set are points and lines.

Figure 10: Uni-scalable sets

A single distance dimension between geometries in a uni-scalable set can act as driving dimension, as long as it is not perpendicular to the scaling direction. 
This is shown in [Figure 11: Rotated scaling direction](#_Ref335832892), which is a rotated version of the model shown in [Figure 10: Uni-scalable sets](#_Ref466906949). Adding any further dimensions that have a component in the scaling direction will result in all such dimensions being marked as over-defined.

Distances perpendicular to the scaling direction will not change as a result of scaling. 
Distance dimensions cannot be added however. 
If they are added, then these will be over-defined.

If a uni-scalable set is rotated as a result of an evaluation, then the scaling direction will be rotated to be consistent with the new orientation, for the duration of that evaluation. 
For example, if a set has a scaling direction in the x direction, and the set is rotated by 90 degrees as a result of an evaluation, then the set will be able to scale in the y direction.

Figure 11: Rotated scaling direction

The scaling direction will often be derived from the direction of a directed geometry within 2D DCM. 
It may also be a direction which is not shared by a directed geometry, for example (0,1) or (1,0).

Note that the scaling direction is supplied by the application through the frustum interface during every evaluation. 
If the scaling direction is not derived from a directed geometry within the uni-scalable set, then the application must ensure that the supplied scaling direction is consistent with any rotation of the uni-scalable set. 
For example, if a uni-scalable set has an initial scaling direction of (1,0) and is rotated by 90 degrees, then the application must ensure that the scaling direction is (0,1) during the next evaluation.

A uni-scalable set is created and used in a similar way to a scalable set, but also requires that a scaling direction be returned through the frustum function DCM\_scaling\_direction.

By default, the DCM will not apply a negative scaling factor to a uni-scalable set. 
However, it is possible to allow negative scaling by setting the option DCM\_OPKEY\_UNI\_SCALABLE\_NEGATIVE\_SCALING to DCM\_OPVAL\_ON using the set\_option function.
