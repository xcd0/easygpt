## 3.7 Bi-scalable sets

Bi-scalable sets can scale in two perpendicular directions. 
A single scaling direction is specified, and then then second scaling direction is inferred to be perpendicular to this in an anti-clockwise orientation. 
Bi-scalable sets have two internal freedoms corresponding to their scaling directions.

A bi-scalable set is created in a smilar way to a uni-scalable set, with a single scaling direction specified through the Frustum. 
The only geometries that can be added to a bi-scalable set are points and lines.

As in the case of uni-scalable sets, by default the DCM will not apply a scaling factor, but the options DCM\_OPKEY\_BI\_SCALABLE\_NEGATIVE\_SCALING\_1 and DCM\_OPKEY\_BI\_SCALABLE\_NEGATIVE\_SCALING\_2 can be used to allow the DCM to apply a negative scaling in one or both directions.
