# 8\. Spline curves

Internally, the DCM uses NURBS curves to represent splines. 
NURBS are used to represent parametric curves in many CAD applications. 
Conventionally, all applications have the same basic definition of a NURBS curve. 
For those readers not familiar with NURBS curve there are many text books on the subject, e.g. 
"The NURBS Book" by Les Piegl and Wayne Tiller (Monographs in Visual Communication, Springer).

The DCM supports a combination of the following methods of defining any particular curve:

- Vectors which will be used as the positions of the control points of the curve.
- DCM geometry nodes whose positions are the control points of the curve. 
It is possible for the DCM to change the shape of a spline curve by moving these points.
- Vectors which represent points which will lie on the spline curve (i.e. 
interpolation points).
- DCM geometry nodes which will lie on the spline curve. 
It is possible for the DCM to change the shape of a spline curve by moving these points.
- Values for the tangent or derivatives at particular locations along the curve. 
These are referred to as interpolation conditions.

In addition, the application specifies the degree, whether a curve is rational, whether a curve is periodic or not, control point weights (if the curve is rational) and the parameter values of any interpolation points or conditions.

The following sections describe how spline curves are supported in the DCM.
