## 8.6 Controlling spline solving behaviour

DCM provides a low-level spline geometry interface which gives an application flexibility to control the behaviour of splines. 
An application may implement a variety of features by implementing the appropriate DCM functions and providing some additional functionality. 
This section describes some of the possibilities, all of which are implemented in the Analyse test program.

### 8.6.1 Control point and interpolation point dependence

This section is for interpolated splines only, i.e. 
splines where the application does not define the spline with control point data.

In general, when a spline is solved, the DCM will attempt to minimise the changes to the control points. 
This is control point dependence. 
For an interpolated spline that has not been defined by control points (data mask element DCM\_BS\_CP\_N not defined), an application may prefer that the DCM should minimise the changes to the interpolation points during solving, i.e. 
interpolation point dependence.

The choice of which solving behaviour is preferred is up to the application. 
The dependence of the spline is set using the DCM\_bs\_dependence type when the spline is created or updated. 
It will be either DCM\_BS\_DEPENDENCE\_CP or DCM\_BS\_DEPENDENCE\_INTERP.

With interpolation point dependence the interpolation points will tend to remain in the positions they have been created at or moved to. 
This would probably suit an application that displayed the interpolation points to the user as the primary means of editing the spline shape. 
With control point dependence the control points will tend to remain in their initial positions.

A disadvantage of interpolation point dependence is that it is not possible to move only a single interpolation point to satisfy a new constraint without getting some change to the shape of the entire curve. 
With control point dependence changes to the curve shape can be restricted to the region of the control points that are modified.

### 8.6.2 Re-parameterisation of interpolated splines

By default, the application may modify the parameters at which the interpolation conditions act when solving splines with interpolation conditions. 
If the interpolation conditions remain at fixed parameter values, then this can lead to some undesirable curve shape effects. 
In particular, when two neighbouring interpolation points are moved closer together, the curve will tend to form a loop or bulge between the points.

This problem can be countered using re-parameterisation, implemented externally by the application for any parameterisation scheme, or internally by the DCM for chord length parameterisation. 
Re-parameterisation allows, for example, the dragging of an interpolation point along the spline (changing the parameterisation continually), while the other interpolation points do not move. 
Only splines with interpolation point dependence can have their parameterisation changed.

When the spline data parameterisation field is set to DCM\_BS\_PARAMETERISATION\_VARIABLE (default DCM behaviour), the application is given the opportunity to modify the parameterisation of the spline every time the DCM changes its shape via a call to the Frustum function DCM\_spline\_update. 
The application may use any parameterisation, e.g. 
centripetal parameterisation. 
The application must recalculate the parameterisation of the spline according to new interpolation point positions supplied by the DCM. 
This will typically happen several times whenever the model is evaluated. 
Note that the start and end parameters of the curve cannot be changed.

If the desired dynamic re-parameterisation scheme is a chord length parameterisation, the application can make a more efficient use of the DCM by setting the spline parameterisation field to DCM\_BS\_PARAMETERISATION\_CHORD\_LENGTH in order to let the DCM re-parameterise the spline automatically when needed. 
Similarly, if the desired re-parameterisation is centripetal parameterisation the application should set to DCM\_BS\_PARAMETERISATION\_CENTRIPETAL to have the DCM re-parameterise the spline automatically.

Chord length parameterisation means that the normalised parameter value of an interpolation point is defined to be equal to the normalised sum of chord lengths up to that point (chords are straight-line segments between interpolation points). In this scheme, the DCM shall take care of ensuring that this definition applies at all times for interpolation points and for any interpolation conditions at those points. 
An interpolation condition that applies somewhere between two adjacent interpolation points shall be given new parameter value so as to preserve the ratio of the distances along the spline to those two interpolation points, using a linear interpolation in parameter space. 
For example, if two adjacent interpolation points have their parameter values changed from 0.1 and 0.3 to 0.15 and 0.4 respectively, an interpolation condition that started off being applied halfway between them, at 0.2, would be re-positioned to remain halfway, at 0.275. In other words, each of the parameter intervals between interpolation points shall be uniformly stretched or compressed depending on whether the straight-line distance between its two endpoints grows or shrinks relative to the total chord length of the spline.

The behaviour for centripetal paprameterisation is the same, but with parameters calculated according to the centripetal method, which produces a different spline curve between interpolation points. 
An application which uses centripetal parameterisation for splines can improve efficiency by using the automatic parameter generation in the DCM.

For automatic chord length or centripetal parameterisation, the following conditions must be met or else calls to add\_spline\_g, update\_spline or replace\_spline shall fail and return DCM\_BS\_STATUS\_BAD\_DATA.

- The spline must be an interpolation spline, with interpolation dependence (DCM\_BS\_DEPENDENCE\_INTERP), and,
- The spline must have interpolation points at its two ends, i.e. 
DCM\_BS\_ITYPE\_COI or DCM\_BS\_ITYPE\_G\_COI conditions at the maximum and minimum parameter values.

The original behaviour of chord length parameterisation was that the DCM would only update the parameters during a call to evaluate or similar. 
An application could add interpolation conditions using any parameterisation, and these would only be converted into chord length parameters during evaluate. 
This meant that enquiring the parameters through the DCM would return the old parameters if the enquiry function were called immediately after the spline was created, or after update spline was called, instead of the desired chord-length parameters. 
This has been changed from version 70 to update the parameters at the time of creation and after update\_spline is called. 
The legacy behaviour can be restored by using to DCM\_BS\_PARAMETERISATION\_CHORD\_LENGTH\_69.

### 8.6.3 Inserting new interpolation conditions without changing shape

In some cases, adding a new interpolation condition, even if it is given the current measured value, will cause a curve shape to change. 
This is because the complexity of the curve (i.e. 
the number of control points) must be increased to allow for the interpolation condition. 
In these circumstances, it is possible for an application to reposition the control points and change the knot vector such that the change in curve shape is prevented.

The Analyse test program implements a switch Splines… Conditions… Automatic knot insertion to enable this behaviour. 
When this mode is enabled, Analyse will calculate the required control point positions and knot vector to maintain the original shape when interpolation conditions are added. 
This functionality uses the knot insertion algorithm set out in chapter 5 of "The NURBS Book". That algorithm specifies how a new control point can be inserted into a spline curve without changing the curve shape, by specifying the position of the new control point and making some changes to the positions of existing control points.

In order to implement this approach, the application will need to determine the starting control point positions and knot vector. 
This information can be enquired from the DCM. 
The application will then have to calculate the new control point vector and knot vector and supply these to the DCM when updating the spline. 
If the application was previously not supplying the knot vector then it must begin to do so at this point and continue to do so for this spline.

### 8.6.4 Adding freedoms to spline curves

When an application wishes to add a new interpolation condition to a spline without restricting the freedoms available in the model, the creation only duration for interpolation conditions can be used. 
As with other interpolation conditions, this will cause the DCM to add additional complexity to the curve so that the condition can be applied.

Interpolation conditions with creation only duration are only used by the DCM to generate the initial spline shape. 
They are not preserved during an evaluation. 
However, following an evaluation it is possible for the application to read the current value of that condition via enquire\_spline.

Creation only interpolation conditions may be used by applications when the user wishes to apply a new constraint to a spline without altering the shape of the curve. 
The addition of a creation only interpolation condition, of the right type and value, together with the constraint will ensure that the curve has sufficient freedoms to satisfy the constraint without changing shape. 
For example, when applying a tangency to a line, the application could also add a interpolation DCM\_BS\_ITYPE\_DERIV1 condition with creation only duration to preposition the curve.

### 8.6.5 Removing freedoms from spline curves

Once a spline curve has been added to the DCM there are a number of methods available to remove its degrees of freedom and make its shape and position fully defined:

- Spline curves can be fixed, removing all their freedoms.
- The rigidity property of the spline curve can be used to remove internal spline freedoms. 
The rigidity of the spline may be configured as:

- DCM\_BS\_RIGIDITY\_RIGID – creates a rigid spline which has only rigid body freedoms.
- DCM\_BS\_RIGIDITY\_SCALABLE – creates a scalable spline which has rigid body freedoms plus a single internal freedom for its size.
- DCM\_BS\_RIGIDITY\_UNI\_SCALABLE – creates a uni-scalable spline which has rigid body freedoms plus a single directional scaling freedom.
- DCM\_BS\_RIGIDITY\_BI\_SCALABLE – creates a bi-scalable spline which has rigid body freedoms plus a two independent scaling freedoms perpendicular to each other, defined by a single direction.

When configuring a uni- or bi-scalable spline curve, it is necessary for the application to specify the scaling direction through the update\_spline function. 
The scale direction is fixed with respect to the spline curve and will only be changed by the DCM as a result of a rotation of the spline curve. 
In this case, the same rotation will be applied to the scale direction. 
See [16.6.1 DCM\_bs\_data – spline data structure](16.6._Spline_functions.md)
By default the DCM will always apply a positive scaling factor to a uni-scalable spline.

To allow negative scaling to all such curves in the same DCM instance, it is possible to set one or more of the options DCM\_OPKEY\_UNI\_SCALABLE\_NEGATIVE\_SCALING (for uni-scalable) or DCM\_OPKEY\_BI\_SCALABLE\_NEGATIVE\_SCALING\_1 and/or DCM\_OPKEY\_BI\_SCALABLE\_NEGATIVE\_SCALING\_2 (for bi-scalable) to DCM\_OPVAL\_ON. 
Note that the DCM will not apply a scaling factor of exactly 0.

- DCM\_BS\_RIGIDITY\_FLEXIBLE – creates a flexible spline which has a number of freedoms dependent on its number of control points, rationality, periodicity etc.

- DCM constraints. 
Most of the DCM dimensions and constraints can be applied to spline curves. 
See [7.2 Dimensions and constraints to parametric curves](7.2._Dimensions_and_constraints_to_parametric_curves.md)
- Interpolation conditions. 
Interpolation conditions that are specified to act during the DCM solve (i.e. 
duration of always – DCM\_BS\_INTERP\_DURATION\_ALWAYS) will remove freedoms from the curve. 
See [16.6.2 Interpolation condition types](16.6._Spline_functions.md)

### 8.6.6 Solving interpolation conditions without evaluating constraints

The DCM will calculate the shape of a spline in two distinct ways:

- Immediately after the spline is added or has its definition changed by a call to update\_spline its shape will be updated by the DCM. 
Interpolation conditions will be satisfied if their duration indicates that this should be done. 
No account is taken of constraints and dimensions onto the spline and these may not be satisfied by the resulting curve. 
This is referred to as refreshing the spline.
- The shape of the spline will also be calculated when the model is evaluated by the DCM functions evaluate, re\_evaluate, move\_and\_evaluate and dynamic\_evaluate. 
As well as ensuring that the spline shape matches any interpolation conditions this will also solve constraints to splines as for other geometry, or give them status codes if they cannot be satisfied.

The DCM provides spline evaluator functions to enquire the position of the curve given a parameter (see section [8.7 Calling the DCM spline evaluators](8.7._Calling_the_DCM_spline_evaluators.md)

The refresh only duration option for interpolation conditions provides a mechanism for an application to specify interpolation conditions that are only applied when the application asks the DCM to refresh the spline independently of the DCM constraint solver functions (i.e. 
evaluate, re\_evaluate, move\_and\_evaluate and dynamic\_evaluate).

Using the refresh only duration for interpolation conditions allows an application to add conditions that would otherwise over-define a spline curve when the model is evaluated. 
The DCM can then be used to apply these conditions when the curve shape is refreshed after evaluate by calling the update\_spline function, causing the curve to snap to the specified interpolation conditions.

### 8.6.7 Editing splines

Various methods are available to change the shape of DCM spline curves. 
The choice of which method is more appropriate depends on how the curve is to be changed.

- Dragging of control or interpolation points using dynamic\_evaluate.



If the spline has been defined by making control or interpolation points that are points in the DCM model, the dynamic\_evaluate function can be used to dynamically reposition the points of the curve. 
The method can be used to drag a single point or to move several together by specifying transforms for each.
- Via the update\_spline function.



This method gives the greatest control as it allows the application to change most of the spline data. 
The method is useful when one-off changes are to be made such as the addition of new interpolation conditions. 
It is also suitable for use when the user is making changes to values and knows the specific new values to use. 
The following limitations apply, however:

- update\_spline causes the DCM model to be reset – forcing a full evaluation next time.
- The application must not remove any bits from the data mask. 
That is, once a particular element of the spline data structure has been supplied to the DCM for that spline, it will always apply in subsequent updates. 
So it is not possible, for example, to turn a control point spline into an interpolated spline. 
The DCM would assume that the previously supplied values of number of control points and control point values still applied.
- A further option using this method is to return NULL for the spline data which will indicate to the DCM that some of the defining control or interpolation points have changed. 
This will cause the DCM to enquire the new positions of the points via the Frustum. 
This can be useful if the application wishes to update the spline shape without performing a DCM evaluate. 
When update\_spline is called with NULL spline data, the DCM is not reset.

- During evaluate via the DCM\_spline\_update Frustum.



This method is ideal for use with dynamic modifications because it does not cause a DCM reset and so can be used with move\_and\_evaluate and dynamic\_evaluate. 
A typical use would be to allow the user to drag a symbol representing an interpolation condition around whilst dynamically updating the spline on screen. 
For example, a tangent direction could be varied by moving the endpoint of an arrow. 
For each step, the application could determine the direction of the arrow symbol and call re\_evaluate, updating the interpolation condition value to the new direction.



The limitation of this approach is that only certain spline properties may be updated. 
The following properties can be changed if they have been specified for the curve: Control point weights and interpolation condition vector.



For rigid or fixed splines, it is also possible to make more fundamental changes via DCM\_spline\_update during a move\_and\_evaluate function. 
The full details of the changes that are possible are set out in [17.4.1 DCM\_spline\_update – Allow update of spline properties](17.4._Functions_for_spline_curves.md)
