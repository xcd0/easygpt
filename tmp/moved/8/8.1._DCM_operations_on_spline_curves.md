## 8.1 DCM operations on spline curves

The DCM allows the application to do the following:

- Create a spline curve using any suitable combination of data.
- Enquire the data that defines an existing spline curve.



The application can choose which data is returned. 
For example, it can choose to only enquire the current control point positions. 
For splines defined by control or interpolation vectors, it is possible to enquire the current positions of these vectors after the spline has been modified.
- Re-define a spline curve, while still preserving all existing constraints to the curve.



It is possible for the application to only update certain data. 
For example, it is possible to give a new array of weights but to leave all other data unchanged.
- Move a spline rigidly by applying a transform.
- Call parametric evaluator functions for the spline curve.

Details of these are given in the following sections, and in section [16.6 Spline functions](16.6._Spline_functions.md)
