## 8.4 Periodic splines

On a periodic spline it is possible to achieve continuity at the "join" by increasing the number of control points, weights and the length of the knot vector so that they "wrap around". For interpolated splines, DCM can automatically generate the necessary wrapping of the knots if the knot vector (and control points) are not specified by the application.  For control point splines, applications must add the extra knots directly.

For C2 continuity, it is necessary to increase the number of defining points by the degree of the curve, i.e.

cp\_n= cp\_unique + degree(or: interp\_n= interp\_unique \+ degree )

and:

- The points and weights are also wrapped, i.e.:

    cp\_g\_nodes\[cp\_unique + i\] = cp\_g\_nodes\[i\]

     cp\_weights\[cp\_unique + i\] = cp\_weights\[i\]  i=0,..,degree-1
- The knot vector (which will be of length cp\_n + degree + 1) must also be wrapped.

The knot vector is made up of real and imaginary knots. 
The first and last degree knots are imaginary and the knots in between are real.

The intervals between the first degree + 1 knots (degree imaginary knots and one real knot) should be the same as the intervals between the last degree + 1 real knots.

The intervals between the last degree + 1 knots (one real knot and degree imaginary knots) should be the same as corresponding intervals between the first degree + 1 real knots.

The imaginary knots can be computed as follows:

Given:

real knots: kv\[degree\] ... kv\[cp\_unique + degree\]

period = kv\[cp\_unique + degree\] - kv\[degree\];

for(int i=0; i<degree; i++)

      {

      kv\[i\] = kv\[cp\_unique + i\] – period

      kv\[cp\_unique + degree + i + 1\] = kv\[degree + i + 1\] + period

      }

Typically the first real knot value is set to 0 so that the parameter range is from 0 to period (see sections [8.5.3 Interpolated point periodic spline](8.5._Examples_of_spline_curves.md)
