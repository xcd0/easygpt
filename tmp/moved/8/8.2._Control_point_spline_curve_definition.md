## 8.2 Control point spline curve definition

The basic mathematical definition of a NURBS curve involves control points. 
DCM allows an application to specify a spline using control points, and this requires the following parameters to be given:

- The rigidity of the curve (that is, whether it is rigid, scalable or flexible).
- The degree of the curve.
- The periodicity of the curve.



Periodic curves are closed and have no "start" or "end" although the parameter values will "jump" at a position on the curve. 
However, the curve will be continuous in the degree-1 derivative at this position.
- A number (which must be greater than degree+1) of control points which are positions in space or existing points in the DCM.
- For each control point, a weight that influences how closely the curve will pass to the control points. 
NURBS can also be non-rational, which implies all the weights are unity.
- A knot vector that controls how the curve is parameterised.

An application can define a spline by passing in this data. 
It can also extract this data for any spline irrespectively of how it was defined. 
This may be helpful if the spline is to be input to another application.
