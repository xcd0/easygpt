## 8.7 Calling the DCM spline evaluators

Most applications that work with spline curves will include the capability to perform operations on the curves independently of the DCM. 
For example, they will be able to draw a spline curve. 
Most of these operations will depend upon being able to find positions and derivatives on the curve at a given parameter value.

Although it is expected that applications will be able to enquire the basic spline data from the DCM and then to use their own functions, the DCM also allows an application to enquire the following information:

- The parameter range of the curve.
- The number and position of any derivative discontinuities on the curve.
- Position and derivatives on the curve given a parameter value (i.e., a parametric evaluator function). For curves with discontinuities, it is possible to specify the side of the discontinuity for which data is returned.
