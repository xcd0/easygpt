## 6.2 Implied constraints

The dimensions and constraints that are applied by the application inform the DCM of the relationships between the geometries. 
However, there are other cases where relationships between geometries are not explicitly given but will be implied by the DCM. 
For example, if a point has distance dimensions to two fixed lines, the DCM will say it is over-defined if the two fixed lines are geometrically parallel. 
This is independent of the values of the dimensions. 
To test for this case, the DCM will check if the angle between the lines is less than the angular resolution. 
A similar situation arises if a point is dimensioned to two parallel lines in the same rigid set.

If these implied relationships are not determined then the diagnostics returned by the DCM would be misleading.

The DCM will only search for geometric relationships between certain pairs of geometries. 
This depends upon whether the geometries are fixed, frozen or free. 
If one or both of the geometries are in a set it also depends on if the set if fixed, frozen or free. 
See section [6.3.2.3 Solve, imply or believe constraints](6.3._Frozen_geometry.md)

### 6.2.1 Effect of implied constraints

The constraints that are implied between fixed geometry may result in the DCM recognising a configuration as over-constrained but consistent. 
Hence, redundant constraints may be ignored.

For example, suppose that the application has made a rectangle with four lines and perpendicular and parallel constraints. 
Next, a pair of fixed parallel lines are created, and two opposite sides of the rectangle are made parallel to the two fixed lines. 
This model is over-defined, because only one of the parallel constraints is necessary. 
However, the DCM will deduce that the fixed lines are parallel, and that the model is over-constrained but consistent. 
Hence, the model will solve successfully.

If now the application rotates one of the fixed lines, the DCM will no longer deduce the parallel constraint and hence the model will be over-defined.

If the two fixed lines are instead made frozen, then the DCM will not have implied the parallel constraint, and the model would be over-defined even if all of the constraints are satisfied. 
Hence, the application knows that the model has not solved just because of the position of fixed geometry. 
[Figure 44: Before rotating line - After rotating line](#_Ref420986984) shows the model described above.

In general, using frozen geometry instead of fixed geometry will result in fewer models solving. 
However, it does mean that the application will build models that can be modified more easily. 
This may be an advantage where models can be modified by rebuilding a "history" of how they were originally made.
