# 6\. Fixed, Frozen and Free Geometry

The DCM supports geometry with three states:

- Fixed - Uses the DCM fix function
- Frozen \- Uses the DCM freeze function
- Free \- Geometry that is neither fixed or frozen

This chapter describes the differences between the states and outlines some possible uses of frozen and fixed geometry.

Note that DCM also provides the "lock" constraint method to specify (free) geometry that must not be moved by DCM. 
This has some advantages over using the fix/free/frozen status.
