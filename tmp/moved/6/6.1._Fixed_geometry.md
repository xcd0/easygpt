## 6.1 Fixed geometry

Geometry that is fixed has the following behaviour:

- Fixed geometries and fixed sets will not be moved by the DCM.
- The DCM will search for constraints between pairs of fixed geometries based on their relative positions.
- Application dimensions and constraints between fixed geometry will be ignored by the DCM.
- Incremental evaluation (using re\_evaluate) is invalid if fixed geometry is moved by the application.
- Fixed geometries can be moved by the application using dynamic\_evaluate, but not if they are in sets.
