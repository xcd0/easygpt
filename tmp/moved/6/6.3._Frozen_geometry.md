## 6.3 Frozen geometry

Geometry that is frozen has the following behaviour:

- Frozen geometries that are not in a set will not be moved by the DCM.
- The DCM will not search for constraints between two frozen geometries or between a fixed and a frozen geometry.
- The DCM will assume that an application constraint between two frozen geometries that is currently satisfied will remain satisfied even if the application moves the frozen geometry. 
It will take account of these constraints when solving the model.
- The DCM will make no other assumptions about the position of frozen geometries or frozen sets.
- Incremental evaluation (using re\_evaluate) is possible when frozen geometry has been moved by the application.

Note that in general models with frozen geometries will be less likely to be successfully solved by the DCM than models with fixed or free geometry. 
An example of this is given below.

### 6.3.1 Application constraints between frozen geometry

In some cases the application may know that some relationships between frozen geometry will be maintained even though the geometry will be moved. 
For example, a model may contain two frozen lines that are geometrically parallel. 
If the application knows that the lines will be translated, but never rotated, it can apply a parallel constraint between the lines. 
Provided that this constraint is satisfied by the position of the geometries, the DCM will take this into account when solving.

### 6.3.2 Frozen geometry and sets

The DCM also supports free, frozen and fixed geometry in rigid sets. 
The rigid sets in turn may also be free, frozen or fixed.

The most simple (and the most useful for applications) is the case where frozen geometries are in free sets. 
The DCM will deduce constraints between free geometries that are in the same rigid set. 
However, it will not do this between frozen geometries in a free set. 
An application can use frozen geometries in a rigid set when it does not want any deductions to be made. 
For example, the application may know that the position of the geometry in the set will be modified in the future.

The full details of the behaviour in these cases are described in the following sections. 
In most cases the simple overview above will suffice.

#### 6.3.2.1 Full description

A geometry node can have one of three states: free, frozen or fixed. 
Additionally, a geometry can be inside a rigid set, which can also be free, frozen or fixed. 
The way that the DCM behaves is modified when the geometry is in a set - see below for details.

Between each pair of geometries the DCM will do one of the following:

- SOLVE CONSTRAINTS - Any application constraints between the geometries will be solved in the usual way.
- IMPLY CONSTRAINTS - This means that the DCM will check if any constraints are implied by the positions of the geometries. 
Any constraints or dimensions applied by the application will be ignored.
- BELIEVE CONSTRAINTS - The DCM will not deduce any constraints. 
However, if there are any application constraints between the geometries that are satisfied by the position of the geometries then the DCM will use these constraints when it solves the model.

#### 6.3.2.2 Global and local states of geometries

Geometries have two states: a "local" state and a "global" state. 
The local state is just the state of the actual geometry, i.e., free, frozen or fixed. 
The global state is given in [Table 3 Global state of geometries](#_Ref420912623):

#### 6.3.2.3 Solve, imply or believe constraints

Two different sets of rules are used to decide what action to take with each pair of geometries. 
One set of rules is only used to compare two geometries within the same set. 
The other set of rules is used in all other cases, i.e., two geometries that are not in a set, two geometries where one is in a set and one is not and two geometries in different sets.

The actions taken if the geometries are not in the same set depend upon the global state of the geometries and are as follows:
