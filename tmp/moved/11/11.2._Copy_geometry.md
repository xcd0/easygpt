## 11.2 Copy geometry

Most geometry types can be copied by adding another geometry of the same type. 
For parametric geometry it is possible to add a special copy curve type to represent an exact copy of the original, transformed to another location.

A copy curve can be created for an offset curve, a spline, a conic, or an evaluated parametric. 
Copy curves are not supported for the other geometry types.

Various constraints may be used in combination with copy geometry. 
A typical example is the use with DCM pattern constraints to create a regular array of identical copies of part of a sketch.

Note that the copy curve type inherently maintains the same shape as the original curve even when there is no pattern constraint between them. 
For simple circles it is necessary to use equal radius constraints to avoid changes in radius, whilst for ellipses a complex construction is currently required to ensure both radii are preserved.

### 11.2.1 Exact copies of offsets, splines and parametrics

The DCM has a facility to represent a curve that is an exact copy of an offset curve, a spline or an evaluated parametric curve. 
This curve type is known as a copy curve and it is added to the DCM using the function add\_copy\_g. 
Note that the Frustum function DCM\_g\_identify is never called for a copy curve.

Figure 63: Copy curves used to pattern a spline curve

The curve used to define the copy curve is known as the copy parent. 
Note that in contrast to offset curves, copies of copy curves are not supported. 
There is no need for this since the copy of a copy is the same as the original (whereas an offset of an offset is not always equivalent to an offset of the original curve).

The figure above shows that the use of copy curves does not impose an arbitrary directionality on constraint solving – constraints on the copy curves can drive the original curve shape, for example.

For copies of offset curves, the exact properties of the copy curve will depend on the offset root of the copy parent. 
Therefore it is necessary to define the copy root as the copy parent curve (for copies of non-offsets) and the offset root curve for copies of offset curves.

The properties on a copy curve depend on its copy parent. 
The copy will have the same periodicity as the copy parent. 
The copy curve is parameterised the same way as the root curve. 
If the root curve is an ellipse then the copy curve is parameterised in the same way as an ellipse (i.e. 
from 0 to 2π in an anti-clockwise direction).

For copies that have a root curve that is a an evaluated parametric, DCM calls the parametric evaluator function only on the root curve, not on the copy curve. 
For those copies where the root curve is a spline or an ellipse, DCM can determine the shape internally.

The DCM will enquire the following information for the copy curve:

- The initial transform that maps the copy parent onto the copy curve by calling the Frustum function DCM\_copy\_transform.

Note that the transform is used to specify the starting position of the offset curve. 
It does not specify the desired solution. 
The application needs to add constraints and dimensions to specify the desired solution. 
At the end of the evaluation the DCM will output the new transform by calling the Frustum function DCM\_update\_copy\_transform.

Note that the only information that the DCM will give the application about an offset curve is the copy transform. 
The application is responsible for finding points on the curve (for example, for drawing it) but these can be found easily from the original curve, and the transform.

If a copy curve is created from a regenerated parametric curve the dependence constraints should not be duplicated on the copy curve.

Copy curves are erased from the DCM using the function erase.

#### 11.2.1.1 Copying curves with curve extensions

Copy curves will include any curve extensions ( [7.5 Curve extensions](7.5._Curve_extensions.md)
The copy curve will be an exact copy of the copy parent including any curve extensions.

Curve extensions cannot be defined separately for copy curves and DCM cannot be directed to ignore the extensions on the parent if any exist.

### 11.2.2 Dimensions and constraints to copy curves

All constraints that are supported for the copy parent are supported for the copy curve, with the following exceptions:

- Symmetric to another curve that has the same copy root.
- Lock constraints.

Dimensions and constraints to a copy curve (apart from a lock constraint) require help parameters for all root curve types including ellipses. 
The copy curve has the same parameterisation as the root curve. 
The help parameter is enquired via the DCM\_dimension\_parameter Frustum function for all copy curves.

Help points are not enquired for dimensions and constraints to a copy curve when the copy root is an ellipse because the help parameter is required.
