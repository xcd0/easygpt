# 11\. Offset and copy curves

Applications often support offset relationships between curves, where a collection of geometry is offset by a distance from another geometry. 
For lines and circles, the offset curve will be another line or arc. 
However, for other geometry types the offset curve will not be an analytic geometry. 
For these geometries, the offset curve type can be used to represent the offset relationship.

Offset relationships are often used in applications to support offset profiles, where a collection of connected geometries is offset by a specified distance to form a new profile. 
The DCM can be used to support such profiles in a limited way through the use of equal distance constraints. 
However, since the DCM operates only on unbounded geometries it does not provide full support for management of profiles. 
Applications will need to handle cases where offset geometry intersects or has gaps between curves.

Developers with a requirement for advanced management of offset profiles may wish to investigate the Profile Geometry Manager component. 
The PGM operates on bounded geometry such as edges, loops and profiles and provides functionality to generate offsets of any open or closed profile, ensuring that the offset profile is fully connected with no self intersections or gaps. 
The DCM is only concerned with the unbounded offset geometry. 
As a result, if the offset distance is too large the profile may become self-intersecting and the application will have to take the appropriate actions.

### 11.1.1 Creating offset geometry

The type of offset geometry to add varies according to the geometry that is to be offset:

- Lines

The offset of a line is another parallel line.
- Circles

In most cases the offset of a circle arc is another concentric circle. 
Offsetting a circle inwards by a distance exactly equal to the circle radius would result in a zero radius circle. 
However, it is not possible to offset a circle inwards by a distance that is greater than its radius as this would imply the creation of a negative radius circle, which is not supported by the DCM.
- Points

A point can be offset to a circle. 
An application may wish to offset a point in order to fill a gap between two offset lines.
- Ellipses, splines, conics, and evaluated parametric curves

The offsets to these curves are created as a special geometry type - an offset curve. 
Note that it is also possible to create offsets of these offset curves. 
See section [11.1.3 Exact offset of ellipses and parametrics](#_Ref279073227) for more details about offset curves.

Note that it is advisable for the application to create the offset geometries on the correct side of the original geometries. 
This ensures that the DCM will solve the model in the correct chirality. 
It is possible, in most circumstances, to change the chirality of individual pairs of offset-geometries if one or more are on the incorrect side of the original geometries. 
See the DCM function change\_chirality for details on how to do this.

For points, lines and circles the offset geometry is added to the DCM using the usual add\_g. 
Offset curves are added with a different function.

### 11.1.2 Constraining offset curves

The offset curves are typically constrained to their parent curve by using equal distance constraints. 
Equal distance constraints are placed between two pairs of geometries, and imply that the distance between the first pair is the same as the distance between the second pair. 
It is necessary to also add concentric constraints between corresponding circles or a circle and its corresponding point. 
It is not necessary to add parallel constraints between a line and its offset - this will be implied by the equal distance constraint.

To specify the actual offset distance the application can add a single distance dimension between two geometries in the profiles. 
Alternatively, the offset distance can be left under-defined. 
Note that if an application has offset a circle to a point the offset distance cannot be specified independently of the circle radius.

Note that the DCM will only solve equal distance constraints between two circles or a circle and a point when they have been made concentric. 
This is not a fundamental requirement but is a restriction of the DCM in the current release.

It is necessary for the application to create the offset curves in the correct chirality. 
For analytic types it is sufficient to position them on the right side of the base curve. 
For offset curves, the chirality is specified when the offset curve is created via the Frustum.

### 11.1.3 Exact offset of ellipses and parametrics

The DCM can be used to create an exact offset to an ellipse or a parametric curve. 
This curve type is known as an offset curve and it is added to the DCM using the function add\_offset\_g. 
Note that the Frustum function DCM\_g\_identify is never called for an offset curve and no DCM\_g\_type is defined for this geometry. 
Offset curves are directed; an offset curve has the same direction as its offset root curve.

The curve used to define the offset curve is known as the offset parent. 
It is possible to create an offset curve from another offset curve, i.e. 
an offset curve can be the parent of another offset curve. 
The original ellipse or parametric curve is known as the offset root.

![fig53_offset_curves.bmp](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/2ddcm_manual_3.png)

Figure 61: Examples of offset curves

[Figure 61: Examples of offset curves](#_Ref480177712) shows some examples of offset curves. 
The curve offset\_p is offset from a parametric curve. 
The curve offset\_e1 is the offset of an ellipse. 
The curve offset\_e2 is offset from offset\_e1. Hence both offset\_e1 and offset\_e2 have the same offset root (the ellipse).

An offset curve is generated from the offset root, using the combined sum of the any offset distances to that root via any intermediate parents. 
So in the example above, ellipse is the generator of both offset\_e1 and offset\_e2, with the sum of the offset distances of offset\_e1 and offset\_e2 used to evaluate the position of offset\_e1. Since the distance value required to evaluate the offset curve shape is the distance to the offset root, a specific function is provided to query that value (query\_offset\_distance).

This means that in theory, the offset curve shape for the offset of an offset is not guaranteed to be the exact offset of the immediate offset\_parent, particularly where self-intersections might occur. 
But it does mean that evaluating these offsets of offset is no more complex than evaluating the direct offsets. 
Not also tha an offset of and offset that has equal and opposite signed distances will be coincident to the original offset root.

The properties on an offset curve depend on its offset root and on any curve extensionsÂ  that may be added by the application (see section [7.5 Curve extensions](7.5._Curve_extensions.md)
The offset to a non-periodic parametric curve is also non-periodic. 
The offset to a periodic parametric curve is only periodic if the parametric curve is tangent continuous. 
The offset curve is parameterised the same way as the root curve. 
If the root curve is an evaluated parametric then the parametric evaluator is only called for the root curve. 
Offsets of splines and conics are defined internally and no parametric evaluators are called.

The DCM will enquire the following information for the offset curve:

- The initial orientation relative to its parent by calling the Frustum function DCM\_offset\_orientation.
- The initial distance between the offset curve and its parent by calling the Frustum function DCM\_offset\_distance.

Note that both the initial distance and the initial orientation are only used to specify the starting position of the offset curve. 
They do not specify the desired solution. 
The application needs to add constraints and dimensions to specify the desired solution. 
At the end of the evaluation the DCM will output the new orientation and distance by calling the Frustum function DCM\_update\_offset\_data.

Note that the only information that the DCM will give the application about an offset curve is the offset distance and the offset side. 
The application is responsible for finding points on the curve (for example, for drawing it) but these can be found easily from the original curve, and a knowledge of the offset distance and side. 
Similarly, if the offset curve has extensions, the application will need to calculate the extension shape based on the properties (i.e. 
the position and 1st derivative) of the base curve at the start of the extension and the offset distance and side.

It is possible to create an offset curve that is self-intersecting and has discontinuities if it is offset too far from its parent curve. 
[Figure 62: Self-intersecting offset curves](#_Ref480177790) shows such an offset parametric curve and an ellipse that is also offset too far inwards. 
These discontinuous curves are not recommended due to the unreliability of solutions particularly if a constraint is in the region of one of these discontinuities. 
Similarly, offsetting parametrics with tangent discontinuities should be avoided.

If an offset curve is created from a regenerated parametric curve the dependence constraints should not be duplicated on the offset curve.

### 11.1.4 Erasing an offset curve

Offset curves are erased from the DCM using the function erase. 
On erasing a curve the DCM will automatically delete any curves offset from it. 
For example, on erasing offset\_e1, the DCM will also erase offset\_e2 in [Figure 61: Examples of offset curves](#_Ref480177712) above. 
The DCM will also erase any dimensions or constraints associated with the erased curves.

DCM function: [erase](16.3._Defining_the_model_data.md)

### 11.1.5 Dimensions and constraints to offset curves

The following types of dimensions and constraints may be applied between an offset curve and another geometry that does not have the same offset root:

- Coincident constraint to a point.
- Parallel constraint to any other directed geometry.
- Angle dimensions.
- Lock constraint.
- Tangent constraint to any other curve.
- Normal constraint to any other curve.
- Distance dimension to any other geometry.

Dimensions and constraints to an offset curve require help parameters when the offset root is a parametric. 
The offset curve has the same parameterisation as the root curve.

Help points are always required for dimensions and constraints to an offset curve when the offset root is an ellipse.

The following dimensions and constraints may be applied between an offset curve and another curve with the same offset root (including the offset root itself). These constraints or dimensions do not apply to a specific position on the offset curve but instead they apply to the whole curve. 
Hence, help points or help parameters are not required in these cases:

- Equal distance constraint.
- Coincident constraint.
- Distance dimension.

### 11.1.6 Dragging the offset distance

If the offset distance of an offset curve is not defined by the constraints in the model, it is possible for an application to modify the offset distance dynamically, for example via a drag operation.

The function dynamic\_evaluate can be used to vary the offset distance and perform and incremental solve.

### 11.1.7 Approximate offset of ellipses and parametrics

The offset curve type described above allows the DCM to represent a curve that is an exact offset of an ellipse or a parametric curve. 
Exact offset curves are important in some applications, such as modelling the path of a cylindrical cutter used to machine a profile. 
However, to utilise exact offset curves fully an application may need to include support for other operations on this type of curve.

If an exact offset is not required it is possible for an application to represent an approximate offset of a parametric curve or ellipse with an existing curve type, such as a spline. 
The steps below describe one possible method for doing this:

- Step 1 - Generate an offset curve in the DCM.



The application will need to create a data structure for this curve but will only need this to support the DCM Frustum calls.
- Step 2 - Create points coincident to the offset curve.



The application should create points, and add coincident constraints between them and the offset curve.
- Step 3 - Create and fix p\_nodes.



Each coincident constraint will have an associated help parameter, and the application can generate a p\_node for each of these, and then fix it (see section [7.3.1 Fixing help parameters](7.3._Help_parameters.md)
- Step 4 - Generate an interpolating curve.



The application can now create a curve that passes through the points. 
This curve can be a type that is fully supported by the application (e.g. 
a spline) and can be used to represent an approximate offset to the original parametric curve. 
If the application only wishes to draw the spline then it is not necessary to add it to the DCM. 
Otherwise it can be added as a spline curve.



Note that the DCM can be used to construct a spline curve through the points.



As an added refinement the application can create lines that are tangent to the exact offset curve, generate unfixed p\_nodes for these, and add equal parameter constraints between these p\_nodes and the p\_nodes for the coincident constraints to the corresponding points. 
(See section [7.3.2 Equal parameter constraints](7.3._Help_parameters.md)



Note that the DCM can be used to construct a spline curve through a sequence of points and can also allow tangent and derivative conditions.

Note that it is not possible for an application to place distance dimensions or equal distance constraints between an approximate offset curve generated as described above and the original curve.
