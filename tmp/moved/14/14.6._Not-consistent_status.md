## 14.6 Not-consistent status

One of the NOT\_CONSISTENT\_\* status codes is returned when the DCM has found a solution procedure that it believes will allow it to solve this geometry. 
However, when it tries to implement this procedure it does not find a solution. 
In mathematical terms, the DCM has found an "imaginary" solution for the geometry. 
This section describes when the not-consistent status codes can occur and how an application can modify the model to avoid them.

### 14.6.1 Causes of not-consistent status

Parts of a model may become not-consistent as a result of a number of different operations. 
The most common of these are as follows:

- The application changes the value of a dimension and evaluates the model by calling evaluate or re\_evaluate. 
This will normally occur for cases where there would be large changes to one or more geometries.
- The application adds a dimension or constraint to a model, in order to move geometry, and then evaluates the model.
- The application changes the chirality of one or more dimensions and then evaluates the model.
- When dragging geometries with dynamic\_evaluate the application attempts to input a large transformation.
- When using move\_and\_evaluate the application attempts to moves geometry with a large transformation.

In general, the not-consistent status shows that the application is attempting to make a change to the model that is too large. 
In this context "large" is relative to the size of the model, or how close the model is to a singular solution. 
Typically this status will not occur if a similar but smaller change is made. 
Note that for dragging and incremental evaluation the magnitude of the change is relative to the initial position of the geometry. 
This is the position of the geometry for the first call to dynamic\_evaluate, or the most recent call to evaluate.

When the DCM is solving a model it will decide which solution procedure it will use prior to starting to calculate the transformation for any of the geometries. 
Over-constrained cases are detected at this stage. 
As the DCM calculates the transformations to apply to each geometry it may determine that it is unable to find a solution for one (or more) of the geometries and will mark them as not-consistent. 
The dimensions that the DCM is using to position the geometry will be give the same status code.

When geometry becomes not-consistent the DCM will not be able to position any other geometries that depend on it. 
These geometries and their associated dimensions (and any others that depend on them) will be marked G\_NOT\_CHANGED or D\_NOT\_SOLVED. 
See section [14.7 Nodes which cannot be solved](14.7._Nodes_which_cannot_be_solved.md)

### 14.6.2 Resolving not-consistent problems

It is recommended that the application should evaluate the model frequently so that any problems become apparent to the user as soon as they occur. 
Note that for many operations (such as changing dimension values or chirality) it is possible to use the re\_evaluate function to evaluate the model.

In all cases the application can resolve the problem by reversing the operations that caused it. 
For example, if the not-consistent status code was a result of changing a dimension value, the problem will be resolved by changing the dimension back to its old value and then calling re\_evaluate. 
However, in some cases the application may want to modify other parts of the model to allow the change to be made. 
The following sections describe different ways that can be tried.

When attempting to resolve a problem the application should focus on the geometries and dimensions in the model with the not-consistent status code.

In order to decide how to avoid this status it is useful to consider the different types of not-consistent configurations. 
These are described below.

#### 14.6.2.1 NOT\_CONSISTENT\_DIMENSIONS

In this case, the local configuration is fully dimensioned. 
An example of this is a triangle with sides of length 50, 50 and 120. The DCM will, however, evaluate the boundary cases such as a triangle with sides 50, 50 and 100.

When this status code is returned the following techniques may solve the problem:

- Changing dimension values.
- Changing to a different chirality.

Full details of each of these are given below.

#### 14.6.2.2 NOT\_CONSISTENT\_OTHER

In this case, the local configuration is not fully dimensioned. 
An example of this is when dragging geometry in a partly dimensioned model.

![fig60_dragging_under.bmp](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Not consistent status_1.png)

Figure 70: Dragging an under-defined model

On a model that is not fully dimensioned the following techniques can be used to solve the problem:

- Changing dimension values.
- Adding additional constraints.
- Moving geometry.
- Changing to a different chirality.
- Using a different solving mode.

Full details of each of these are given below.

Note that when solving a model like [Figure 70: Dragging an under-defined model](#_Ref475516914), where a number of under-defined points are connected by distance dimensions only, chain solving can be used to improve performance. 
See section [16.2.4.10 Improve solving behaviour for under-defined points connected by distance dimensions](16.2._Configure_global_DCM_behaviour.md)

#### 14.6.2.3 NOT\_CONSISTENT\_UNKNOWN

In this case, the DCM has been unable to determine the cause of the non-consistent status. 
The techniques mentioned to resolve the NOT\_CONSISTENT\_OTHER (see section [14.6.2.2 NOT\_CONSISTENT\_OTHER](#_Ref514731905)) can be used.

#### 14.6.2.4 NOT\_CONSISTENT

This status code is only returned if the application has called the set\_option function to set the DCM\_OPKEY\_STATUS\_VERSION option to the DCM\_OPVAL\_STATUS\_400 value in which case this replaces all the other NOT\_CONSISTENT\_\* codes.

### 14.6.3 Changing dimension values

The DCM will identify all dimensions that can be changed in order to help it to find a solution. 
For example, in [Figure 69: (a) Inconsistent, will not be changed  (b) Can be evaluated, will be changed](#_Ref474822240) a, all three dimensions will be marked as not-consistent and the application can change the value of any of them in order to produce a valid model. 
Note however that in some cases logical constraints will be marked as not-consistent but obviously these have no value that can be changed.

Changing dimension values can be used to help solve both well-defined and under-defined configurations. 
It is the recommended way of avoiding problems with not-consistent geometry in well-defined configurations.

### 14.6.4 Adding additional constraints or dimensions

In an under-defined model adding more dimensions or constraints will cause the DCM to choose a different solution procedure. 
In many cases this can be used to help the DCM to find the desired solution. 
In some models it may appear that geometry is constrained but when the model is changed it may be apparent that no constraint is present. 
Adding these constraints may help to avoid cases that are not-consistent.

Adding additional constraints or dimensions is the recommended method of avoiding problems with not-consistent geometry in under-defined configurations.

### 14.6.5 Moving geometry

In an under-constrained model it may be possible to help the DCM to find a solution if geometry is moved so that it is closer to the desired solution. 
In a similar way, changing the start value of simple variables may also help. 
This will have no affect on geometry that is fully defined.

Note that changing the position of help points or the values of help parameters will not affect the solution unless this results in a change to the chirality. 
This is discussed in the following section.

### 14.6.6 Changing to a different chirality

Typically a model will have many different chiralities which correspond to different solutions for the geometry. 
Many of these solutions may result in not-consistent geometry. 
Conversely, it may be possible to help the DCM to find a solution by changing to a different chirality.

There are several ways in which the chirality can be changed:

- Explicitly by using the change\_chirality function.
- By moving geometry before evaluating the model.
- By moving the position of help points or changing the values of help parameters.

Changing the chirality may affect models that are well-defined and models that are under-defined. 
For further details about changing chirality see chapter [5\. Chirality](5._Chirality.md)

### 14.6.7 Using a different solving mode

The solving mode can be specified for the evaluate, re\_evaluate, move\_and\_evaluate and dynamic\_evaluate functions. 
The solving mode used will have no affect on geometry that is well-defined; only under-defined geometry will be affected. 
It is recommended that the default solving modes are used for these functions but by changing the solving mode it may be possible to avoid geometry becoming not-consistent. 
In general the affect of the different solving modes is as follows:

- Minimum-move solving will localise the changes, and hence will move the minimum number of geometries. 
If the desired solution requires additional geometries to move then parts of the model may become not-consistent. 
Changing to one of the other solving modes may avoid this.
- Standard solving will avoid changing geometry near singularities, and will propagate transformations onto adjacent geometries. 
These effects will avoid geometry becoming not-consistent for a greater range of movement than minimum move solving.
- Relaxation solving uses a numerical relaxation method to solve under-defined geometry. 
This solving mode will often result in a large number of geometries moving and this may avoid geometry becoming not-consistent for a greater range of movement that other solving modes. 
However, this solving mode may move geometry in an undesirable way.



Applications can offer the user the opportunity to use relaxation solving as a way of avoiding not-consistent geometry. 
However it is important to realise that the changes made may not always be what the user is expecting.
- Weighted standard solving will avoid changing the geometry specified in a list passed to the evaluate function. 
It will otherwise solve in a similar manner to standard solving. 
Note that when used with move\_and\_evaluate, it will avoid moving the geometry that has been positioned with that command. 
This solving mode limits the available options to the DCM and therefore is more likely to result in not-consistent geometry than standard solving.
- Localised solving combines some of the properties of minimum move and standard solving. 
It should reduce the number of geometries moved, but by a strategy of moving local geometry rather than attempting to minimise the actual count of geometries. 
It should therefore solve for a wider range than minimum move mode, but not perhaps as well wide a range as standard solve.
