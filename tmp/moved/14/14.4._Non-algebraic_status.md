## 14.4 Non-algebraic status

This status code will be used by the DCM to identify parts of the model that could be solved if non-algebraic methods were used. 
It is recommended that applications should allow the solving of non-algebraic configurations and then this status code will not be used. 
This is the default mode of operation of the DCM. 
See section [2.5.5 Algebraic and non-algebraic solving](2.5._Evaluating_the_model.md)
