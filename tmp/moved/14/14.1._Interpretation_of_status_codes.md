## 14.1 Interpretation of status codes

Many of the status codes described below are used where the DCM has been unable to solve part of the model. 
Even when a model contains these codes the DCM will still try to solve other parts of the model. 
Note that even if geometry has not been solved it may still be changed by the DCM if this will result in other geometries being solved. 
In cases where the DCM is unable to solve geometry because it depends on other unsolved geometry it will use the G\_NOT\_CHANGED status code.

The DCM will mark all nodes that are relevant to a problem rather than just the first item encountered. 
For example, in an inconsistent triangle with sides 10, 10 and 50, all three dimensions would be marked as D\_NOT\_CONSISTENT\_DIMENSIONS.

The status code of an entity is represented by an enumerated type. 
The order in which the codes are listed below is significant because an entity will be given the first appropriate code. 
For example, the DCM will test to see whether a geometry should have the status G\_OVER\_DEFINED before considering whether it should be G\_NOT\_CONSISTENT\_DIMENSIONS.

In most cases the status of an entity will only be updated when the DCM evaluates the model. 
The exceptions to this are noted below.
