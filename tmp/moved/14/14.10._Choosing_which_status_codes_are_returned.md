## 14.10 Choosing which status codes are returned

The status codes returned by the DCM may change from one release to another. 
For example, the NOT\_CONSISTENT\_\* codes were added in version 4.1.0. The default behaviour of the DCM is to return the most recent set of status codes. 
It is recommended that new integrations should be written to take advantage of all of the available status codes. 
Existing integrations are able to set an option that makes the DCM return only the status codes that were present in a previous release. 
This allows new releases to be integrated more easily.
