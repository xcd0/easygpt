## 14.7 Nodes which cannot be solved

The status codes in this section are used where the DCM is unable to solve part of a model. 
They may not necessarily indicate a problem with the actual entity.

### 14.7.1 D\_BETWEEN\_FIXED

This code is used on dimensions which cannot be solved because of fixed or frozen geometry. 
The DCM is not able to move these geometries.

The code will also be used for dimensions which act on only a single geometry which is fixed or frozen (such as a radius on a fixed circle).

### 14.7.2 D\_BETWEEN\_SET\_MEMBERS

This code is used on dimensions which cannot be solved because they are applied between geometries which are in the same set. 
The DCM is not able to move these geometries relative to each other in order to solve the dimension.

The code will also be used for dimensions which act on only a single geometry which is in a set (such as a radius on a circle in a set).

### 14.7.3 D\_NOT\_SOLVED and G\_NOT\_CHANGED

If the DCM has found parts of the model are non-algebraic, over-defined or not-consistent then geometry that depends on the problem area will not be recalculated. 
The unchanged geometry and associated dimensions will be marked with these codes.
