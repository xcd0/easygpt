# 14\. Status Codes

As well as calculating the position of geometries the DCM will also calculate a status code on each entity in the model. 
These status codes often provide valuable information to the application or the users, especially in cases where the DCM has detected a problem with the way a model is dimensioned.

A range of different status codes can be returned for each entity type. 
This chapter describes in detail the status codes calculated by the DCM for every geometry, dimension, variable, equation and p\_node. 
It also gives some examples of the status codes and explains methods for solving any underlying problems with the model.
