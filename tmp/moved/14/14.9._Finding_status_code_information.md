## 14.9 Finding status code information

The application is able to enquire the current status of any entity in the model by calling the DCM function status. 
Although it is possible to call this function at any time, the DCM will only update the values returned when other functions are called.

Status code information is also output through the Frustum. 
For example, whenever the status code on geometry changes as a result of calling the DCM the Frustum function DCM\_g\_status is called.

To find the extra information about the degrees of freedom of an under-defined geometry the application can call the function underdefined\_status. 
The Frustum function DCM\_new\_underdefined\_status will be called whenever the under-defined status on geometry changes.
