## 14.8 Under-defined status

An under-defined status on a geometry is not an error and the DCM is designed to work with models which are under-defined. 
However, it may be desirable for an application to help users build well-defined models where the geometry is fully specified.

If a model does not contain any fixed or frozen geometry then it is not possible to make geometry well-defined. 
The example below shows an under-constrained design of three points which is made fully defined by fixing two of the points:

### 14.8.1 Detailed under-defined diagnostics

Following an evaluation, geometry will be under-defined if not all of its degrees of freedom have been fully taken up. 
It is possible to find out more information about which degrees of freedom a geometry still has. 
In particular, the DCM can inform the application that the geometry has a combination of the following degrees of freedom:

- The radius of a circle is under-defined.
- The major radius of an ellipse is under-defined.
- The minor radius of an ellipse is under-defined.
- A line, ellipse, parametric, set or a 2D pattern (first direction) has an angular degree of freedom.
- The geometry has a positional degree of freedom. 
This can be returned for any geometry type including sets. 
Note that this will be returned if the geometry has a single positional degree of freedom (for example, a point that can slide along a fixed line) or two positional degrees of freedom (for example, an unfixed point).
- The second direction of a 2D pattern is under-defined.
- The scale of a scalable or uni-scalable set or spline, or the first scale of a bi-scalable set or spline is under-defined.
- The second scale of a bi-scalable set of spline is under-defined.
- A g\_node is singularly under-defined, directly or indirectly.
- The pattern value of a 1D pattern (linear or rotational), or the first value of a 2D pattern, is under-defined.
- The second value of a 2D pattern is under-defined.
- The offset distance of an offset parametric is under-defined.
- A conic’s rho value is under-defined.
- A parametric curve is supported by one or more under-defined g\_nodes.
- A parametric curve is supported by one or more under-defined v\_nodes.
- A parametric curve is supported by g\_nodes that are rigidly constrained to each other and that can be roated rigidly.
- A parametric curve is supported by g\_nodes that are rigidly constrained to each other and that can be translated rigidly.
- A parametric curve is supported by g\_nodes that can be scaled isotropically.
- A parametric curve is supported by g\_nodes that can be scaled isotropically and that can be rotated isotropically.
- A parametric curve is supported by g\_nodes that can be scaled isotropically and that can be translated isotropically.

Furthermore, the DCM can provide precise geometrical information about the freedoms of specific geometries or sets. 
For example, it can determine if a geometry or set is constrained such that it is only free to rotate about a well-defined position and return that position. 
Or if a geometry may only translate in particular direction it will supply the direction.

This information can be provided to the user to help with choosing which dimensions to apply.

Note that the last few entries of the above list refer to freedoms of a parametric curve as a whole. 
Therefore, they contain in general more information about the curve’s freedoms than what would be obtained by looking exclusively at the flags set on the each of the dependee g\_nodes.
