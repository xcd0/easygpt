## 14.5 Over-defined status

The DCM will use this status code when there are too many dimensions for the available degrees of freedom of the geometries. 
The DCM will evaluate as much of the geometry as possible and will inform the application which areas are over-defined. 
When using variables and equations, a similar over-defined situation will arise if there are too many equations, or not enough variables. 
To resolve over-defined problems the application will need to remove dimensions, constraints, equations or rigid sets, or unfix geometry.

Note that when solving a model which contains one or more dimensions with a value the DCM will find a solution that will be satisfied for a general dimension value. 
That is, it will find a solution that allows the value of each dimension to be varied independently. 
If a solution is only valid for particular dimension values then the DCM will consider this to be over-defined.

For example, the geometry and dimensions in the figure below will be over-defined because the dimension values cannot be varied independently, even though they can all be satisfied by appropriate geometry positions.

However, as mentioned in section [2.3 Degrees of freedom](2.3._Degrees_of_freedom.md)
See section [2.7.2 Over-constrained but consistent models](2.7._Solving_over-defined_models.md)

### 14.5.1 Over-dimensioned sets

It is possible to over-constrain rigid sets in the DCM by adding too many constraints. 
The DCM will solve the model as long as the model is consistent and is constrained using logical constraints and rigid distance constraints only.

For example, it is possible to constrain a rectangular profile in a set to be coincident with another rectangular profile of the same size in another set.

### 14.5.2 Reduced over-constrained diagnostics

If a model contains over-defined geometry, the default behaviour of the DCM is to determine exactly which dimensions are contributing to the situation. 
This information would be important if an application needs to indicate to a user, which dimensions to delete. 
However, finding this information can be a relatively expensive operation.

In some cases the application only needs to know that the model contains over-defined geometries, and does not need to know exactly which ones are affected. 
In these cases it is possible to avoid one stage of the analysis. 
In a model that contains a significant amount of over-defined geometry this may considerably reduce the evaluation time.

For more details see chapter [16\. The DCM Interface](16._The_DCM_Interface.md)

### 14.5.3 Pre-evaluate checking

The DCM provides functions that allow an application to perform a check before a dimension is added, to see if it will make the data over-constrained. 
These functions operate much faster than actually applying the dimension and then evaluating the geometry normally. 
For more details see the description of the function check in section [16.12 Pre-evaluate checking of dimensions](16.12._Pre-evaluate_checking_of_dimensions.md)
