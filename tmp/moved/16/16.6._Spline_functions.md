## 16.6 Spline functions

The functions in this section are used for spline curves.

### 16.6.1 DCM\_bs\_data – spline data structure

This structure is used to pass data between the application and the DCM when adding, enquiring and updating spline curves.

typedef struct DCM\_bs\_data {

unsigned int    data\_mask;

unsigned int    bad\_data\_mask;

DCM\_bs\_rigidity   rigidity;

DCM\_bs\_periodicity   periodicity;

DCM\_bs\_rationality   rationality;

DCM\_bs\_dependence   dependence;

DCM\_bs\_solving\_mode  solving mode;

DCM\_bs\_parameterisation  parameterisation;

int     degree;

double\*    knot\_vector;

int     cp\_n;

DCM\_g\_node\_array   cp\_g\_nodes;

double\*    cp\_vectors;

double\*    cp\_weights;

DCM\_bs\_cp\_freedom\*  cp\_freedoms;

int     interp\_n;

DCM\_g\_node\_array   interp\_g\_nodes;

DCM\_v\_node\_array   interp\_v\_nodes;

double\*    interp\_vectors;

double\*    interp\_parameters;

DCM\_bs\_itype\*   interp\_types;

double\*    interp\_weights;

DCM\_bs\_iduration\*   interp\_durations;

DCM\_bs\_istatus\*   interp\_statuses;

int     interp\_con\_bal;

d\_node\_status\*   interp\_d\_statuses;

double\*    scale\_direction

} DCM\_bs\_data;

The meaning of the fields is as follows:

- data\_mask \- A bit-mask to indicate which other fields in the structure are used. 
When the structure is used to create or update a spline curve this argument is used to show which other fields have been filled in by the application. 
When the structure is used for enquiry this field is used to tell the DCM which other fields it should fill in. 
For example, this allows the application to update only the control point weights, or to enquire their value.



The bit-mask is a sum of the values in the following enumerated type:



typedef enum DCM\_bs\_data\_mask {

DCM\_BS\_RIGIDITY= 0x00000001,

DCM\_BS\_PERIODICITY= 0x00000002,

DCM\_BS\_RATIONALITY= 0x00000004,

DCM\_BS\_DEPENDENCE= 0x00000008,

DCM\_BS\_SOLVING\_MODE= 0x00000010,

DCM\_BS\_PARAMETERISATION= 0x00000020,

DCM\_BS\_DEGREE= 0x00000040,

DCM\_BS\_KNOT\_VECTOR= 0x00000080,

DCM\_BS\_CP\_N= 0x00000100,

DCM\_BS\_CP\_G\_NODES= 0x00000200,

DCM\_BS\_CP\_VECTORS= 0x00000400,

DCM\_BS\_CP\_WEIGHTS= 0x00000800,

DCM\_BS\_CP\_FREEDOMS= 0x00001000,

DCM\_BS\_INTERP\_N= 0x00002000,

DCM\_BS\_INTERP\_G\_NODES= 0x00004000,

DCM\_BS\_INTERP\_V\_NODES     = 0x00008000,

DCM\_BS\_INTERP\_VECTORS= 0x00010000,

DCM\_BS\_INTERP\_PARAMETERS  = 0x00020000,

DCM\_BS\_INTERP\_TYPES= 0x00040000,

DCM\_BS\_INTERP\_WEIGHTS= 0x00080000,

DCM\_BS\_INTERP\_DURATIONS = 0x00100000,

DCM\_BS\_INTERP\_STATUSES     = 0x00200000,

DCM\_BS\_INTERP\_CON\_BAL= 0x00400000,

DCM\_BS\_INTERP\_D\_STATUSES= 0x00800000

DCM\_BS\_SCALE\_DIRECTION= 0x01000000

} DCM\_bs\_data\_mask;
- bad\_data\_mask – This bit-mask is set by the DCM to give an indication of the reason for failure when it DCM returns DCM\_BS\_STATUS\_BAD\_DATA. 
The bits in the mask correspond to those in [DCM\_bs\_data\_mask](#DCM_bs_data_mask), and show which data caused the failure.
- rigidity – Whether the spline is rigid, scalable or flexible. 
Can have a value of DCM\_BS\_RIGIDITY\_RIGID, DCM\_BS\_RIGIDITY\_SCALABLE, DCM\_BS\_RIGIDITY\_UNI\_SCALABLE or DCM\_BS\_RIGIDITY\_FLEXIBLE.
- periodicity – Whether the spline is periodic or non-periodic. 
Can have a value of DCM\_BS\_PERIODICITY\_NON\_PER or DCM\_BS\_PERIODICITY\_PER.



See section [8.4 Periodic splines](8.4._Periodic_splines.md)
- rationality – Whether the spline is rational or not. 
Can have a value of DCM\_BS\_RATIONALITY\_NON\_RAT or DCM\_BS\_RATIONALITY\_RAT. 
The cp\_weights array will be ignored for non-rational splines.
- dependence – (Only used for interpolated spline, i.e. 
when DCM\_BS\_CP\_N is not set). Specifies whether a spline defined by interpolation points should be treated during evaluate as if it is dependent on the interpolation points or on the internal control points. 
Can have a value of DCM\_BS\_DEPENDENCE\_CP or DCM\_BS\_DEPENDENCE\_INTERP. 
If the spline has interpolation dependence, then the application can use the Frustum function DCM\_spline\_update to reparameterise the spline to support a variable parameterisation. 
Interpolation dependence is also required for automatic chord length reparameterisation.



The default is control point dependence, which is also the behaviour of all control point splines.
- parameterisation – (Only used for interpolated spline, i.e. 
when DCM\_BS\_CP\_N is not set). Specifies whether the application may change the parameterisation (DCM\_BS\_PARAMETERISATION\_VARIABLE), whether the DCM is to implement a variable chord length parameterisation internally (DCM\_BS\_PARAMETERISATION\_CHORD\_LENGTH), or whether the parameterisation is fixed (DCM\_BS\_PARAMETERISATION\_FIXED). The DCM can operate more efficiently with a spline if it knows that the parameterisation will not change. 
If this property is set to DCM\_BS\_PARAMETERISATION\_VARIABLE, the DCM will provide opportunities for the application to adjust the parameterisation via the Frustum function DCM\_spline\_update during evaluations.



The default is DCM\_BS\_PARAMETERISATION\_VARIABLE for interpolated splines.
- solving\_mode – Specifies whether the DCM should attempt to localise changes to the curve to the area at which a constraint is applied. 
The default value is DCM\_BS\_SOLVING\_MODE\_STANDARD. 
In this mode, the DCM will give no priority to any particular control points when moving them to satisfy the constraints to the curve (or interpolation points for interpolation dependent curves). This means that the DCM will tend to move control points even if they are some distance away from any unsatisfied constraints. 
If the option DCM\_BS\_SOLVING\_MODE\_LOCAL is selected the DCM will try to localise the changes in the curve so that only control points near to a constraint are moved to satisfy this constraint. 
Note that this will not minimise the number of control points that move, instead it will usually mean that the closest control points to the constraint move to satisfy the constraint. 
If the spline has interpolation point dependence (DCM\_BS\_DEPENDENCE\_INTERP) then this mode will determine whether interpolation point movement is localised instead of control points.
- degree – An integer giving the degree of the curve.
- knot\_vector – An array of doubles of length cp\_n+degree+1 that give the knot values of the spline curve.
- cp\_n – An integer which gives the number of control points (geometry nodes or vectors) used to define the curve. 
This must be greater than the degree of the curve.



For an interpolated curve, the DCM will create internal control points. 
The application can enquire the number of points by calling the enquire\_spline function and the DCM will fill in this value. 
Alternatively the number of unique control points, cp\_unique, can be calculated from:



![](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Spline functions.png)

where:



n\_pars is the number of unique parameter values at which interpolation conditions have been specified,

n\_condsp is the number of conditions at the pth of such parameter values, and

dofc is the number of degrees removed by the cth interpolation condition at the pth parameter value (which shall depend on the actual type of the condition - see interp\_types).



If the curve is periodic the DCM will repeat degree control points (see section [8.4 Periodic splines](8.4._Periodic_splines.md)
- cp\_g\_nodes – An array of cp\_n g\_nodes. 
These are points that have been added to the DCM and will be used as the control points for the curve. 
Some entries in this array may be NULL, in which case the corresponding vector from the cp\_vectors array will be used for the position of this control point.
- cp\_vectors – An array of vectors which give the positions of the control points. 
The array contains an array of doubles (x1, y1, x2, y2, …), and will be used as the control points for the curve. 
This array will have a length of cp\_n\*2. Passing this array is an alternative to passing the g\_nodes in the cp\_g\_nodes array on a control point spline.
- cp\_weights – An array of doubles which are the control point weights. 
If the curve is non-rational this array is not used. 
Otherwise this array is of length cp\_n.
- cp\_freedoms – An array of length cp\_n, which determines which control points will be moved by the DCM in order to satisfy any interpolation conditions specified by the application. 
Unless otherwise specified, the values for all control points are assumed to be DCM\_BS\_CP\_FREEDOM\_FREE, indicating that all control points may be moved. 
Setting any freedoms to DCM\_BS\_CP\_FREEDOM\_FIXED will fix the position of the control point when interpolation conditions are solved. 
This will reduce the interpolation constraint balance by two.



Note that this is only relevant for local solving of the interpolation conditions (e.g. 
during add\_spline\_g, update\_spline, etc.). The control points are free to move during an evaluation (the application can fix the control point g\_node if it wishes the control point to be fixed during a compute).



This option allows an application to move a control point and to refresh the spline and to guarantee that the control point will remain in the same position after the call. 
Generally, the DCM will allow all control points to move to satisfy interpolation conditions.
- interp\_n – The number of interpolation conditions. 
These conditions are applied at the parameters specified in the interp\_parameters array. 
The minimum number of interpolation conditions is degree + 1.
- interp\_types – An array of length interp\_n specifying the type of each interpolation condition. 
The interpolation types available are described in [16.6.2 Interpolation condition types](#_Ref405389173).



Additional information is specified by the application or returned by the DCM in the [interp\_weights](#interp_weights) and [interp\_weights](#interp_weights) arrays. 
For each interpolation type, the DCM will use the corresponding elements in one of these arrays.



Note that some interpolation types require a scalar property; this is still passed using the [interp\_weights](#interp_weights) array using the first component of the vector only.



Note that the default types will be assumed to be DCM\_BS\_ITYPE\_G\_COI (if interp\_g\_nodes are given) or DCM\_BS\_ITYPE\_COI.
- interp\_g\_nodes and interp\_vectors – Interpolation condition data.



interp\_g\_nodes is an array of interp\_n g\_nodes which will be used as the interpolating points of the curve.



interp\_vectors is an array of interp\_n vectors (interp\_n\*2 doubles) which give the interpolating conditions of the curve. 
The array contains (x1, y1, x2, y2, , xinterp\_n, yinterp\_n). Note that the y values will not be used if the interpolation condition only requires a scalar value.



For a given condition, the DCM will use the corresponding data in either the interp\_g\_nodes or the interp\_vectors arrays. 
The array used depends on the interpolation type (interp\_types)



When interp\_vectors are used, their meaning shall depend on the type of the corresponding interpolation condition as follows:



DCM\_BS\_ITYPE\_COI  – v1(x coordinate), v2 (y coordinate) of the point

DCM\_BS\_ITYPE\_G\_COI  – both v1 and v2 ignored

DCM\_BS\_ITYPE\_DERIV1  – v1(x component), v2 (y component) of the 1st derivative vector

DCM\_BS\_ITYPE\_DERIV2  – v1(x component), v2 (y component) of the 2nd derivative vector

DCM\_BS\_ITYPE\_DERIV1\_DIR  – v1(x component), v2 (y component) to set the direction

         of the 1st derivative vector

DCM\_BS\_ITYPE\_DERIV1\_LEN– v1 (magnitude of the 1st derivative vector), v2 (ignored)
- interp\_v\_nodes – If used, this is an array of v\_nodes (DCM variables) of length interp\_n\*2.



If the application wishes to associate variables with particular interpolation conditions, then it can create simple variables, using add\_v(), and specifying them in this array. 
There may be two variables (v1 and v2) associated with a corresponding interpolation condition and they are interpreted as follows:



DCM\_BS\_ITYPE\_COI  – both v1 and v2 ignored

DCM\_BS\_ITYPE\_G\_COI  – both v1 and v2 ignored

DCM\_BS\_ITYPE\_DERIV1  – v1(x component), v2 (y component) of the 1st  derivative vector

DCM\_BS\_ITYPE\_DERIV2  – v1(x component), v2 (y component) of the 2nd derivative vector

DCM\_BS\_ITYPE\_DERIV1\_DIR – v1(x component), v2 (y component) to set the direction

        of the 1st derivative vector

DCM\_BS\_ITYPE\_DERIV1\_LEN – v1 (magnitude of first derivative vector), v2 (ignored)
- interp\_parameters – An array of doubles which specify the parameters on the curve at the interpolation conditions. 
If the curve is periodic the length of the array will be interp\_n+1, otherwise it will be interp\_n.



The parameters must be in an ascending order. 
Note that it is possible to specify more than one condition at given parameter value.
- interp\_weights – This is an array of doubles of length interp\_n specifying how interpolation conditions are treated if there are too many conditions for the given number of control points. 
The values represent weights, indicating the relative importance of each condition, from 0 (least important) to 1 (most important and the default).



If there are too many interpolation conditions, then the DCM will remove the least important condition(s) until the system is no longer over-defined or no more constraints can be removed. 
Conditions removed in this way will have their [interp\_status](#interp_statuses) set to DCM\_BS\_ISTATUS\_REMOVED.



Note that interpolation conditions with a weight of 1 (or greater) are never removed.
- interp\_durations – This is an array of length interp\_n, that determines whether interpolation conditions are to persist during a DCM compute.



This can have a value of DCM\_BS\_IDURATION\_ALWAYS, (the default), DCM\_BS\_IDURATION\_REFRESH\_ONLY or DCM\_BS\_IDURATION\_CREATION\_ONLY.



The durations allow the application to specify whether the interpolation condition is applied only when the curve is created (DCM\_BS\_DURATION\_CREATION\_ONLY), only when it is created and updated (DCM\_BS\_IDURATION\_REFRESH\_ONLY) or always (DCM\_BS\_IDURATION\_ALWAYS). For example, in a rigid spline some interpolation conditions (e.g. 
natural end conditions) may make the spline over-defined as the curve shape is fixed. 
If the interp\_durations is set to DCM\_BS\_IDURATION\_REFRESH\_ONLY, the spline will not be marked as over-defined but the conditions will still be applied if the curve is updated. 
See section [8.6 Controlling spline solving behaviour](8.6._Controlling_spline_solving_behaviour.md)
- interp\_statuses – This is an array of length interp\_n which can be used to enquire the status of interpolation conditions following calls to add\_spline\_g or update\_spline. 
The possible status codes are:

- DCM\_BS\_ISTATUS\_SOLVED \- the interpolation condition is satisfied by the calculated control point positions.
- DCM\_BS\_ISTATUS\_REMOVED \- the interpolation condition was not used when finding the control point positions (see [interp\_weights](#interp_weights)). It may or may not be satisfied.
- DCM\_BS\_ISTATUS\_OVER\_DEFINED \- the application has specified too many or conflicting interpolation conditions for the given control point freedoms. 
If the condition is given a weight of less than one then it will be removed and this code will not be returned.
- DCM\_BS\_ISTATUS\_NOT\_SOLVED \- the DCM was unable to find a solution that satisfies all interpolation conditions. 
This generally indicates that the spline is not fully defined by its interpolation conditions and the initial control point positions are a long way from solution.

- interp\_con\_bal – The application can enquire this value to obtain a "local" constraint balance for the spline. 
The value is calculated as follows:

- Each control point which is free to move (i.e. 
does not correspond to a fixed g\_node) or has a cp\_freedom of DCM\_BS\_FREEDOM\_FREE) counts +2.
- Each interpolation condition having an [interp\_status](#interp_statuses) other than DCM\_BS\_ISTATUS\_REMOVED counts –1 or –2 (according to the degrees of freedom of the particular condition, as listed in in [16.6.2 Interpolation condition types](#_Ref405389173)
- If interp\_con\_bal<0, then the spline is locally over-defined (i.e. 
there are too many interpolation conditions for the given control point freedoms). If interp\_con\_bal=0, then the spline is well-defined, otherwise the spline is under-defined.

Generally, interpolation conditions will be solved more quickly if the curve is locally well-defined.

- interp\_d\_statuses – When the application indicates that an interpolation condition is to persist throughout a DCM evaluation (by setting its [interp\_duration](#interp_durations) to DCM\_BS\_IDURATION\_ALWAYS), the DCM will make a corresponding internal d\_node (or use an appropriate application d\_node if available). The application may use this array to enquire the current status of these d\_nodes. 
Interpolation conditions not applied during a compute will have a status of D\_UNKNOWN.

Note that these status codes are also reset by any calls to undo\_evaluation in common with other status codes.
- scale\_direction – For a uni- or bi-scalable spline curve the application must specify the scaling direction of the spline using the add\_spline\_g and update\_spline functions.

The scaling direction is fixed with respect to the spline curve and will be rotated by the DCM if the model evaluation requires a rotation of the spline curve. 
Following an evaluation the new scaling direction should be updated in the application using the corresponding enquire\_spline function.

If no scaling direction is specified in the DCM\_bs\_data structure the application will reject the spline data specified in add\_spline\_g. 
See section [16.6.4 add\_spline\_g - Add a spline curve](#_Ref404329643) for information about configuring spline curves.

The scaling factor which the DCM applies to a scalable or uni- or bi-scalable spline curve is a property of the transform applied by the DCM, not a property of the spline itself. 
There is currently no way to enquire the scale transform performed by the DCM on this type of spline curve.

### 16.6.2 Interpolation condition types

The interpolation types supported for DCM splines are described below. 
For each type the number of degrees of freedom that it takes from the control points is identified. 
Where a condition only returns 1 degree of freedom, it must be combined with a second, different condition that also removes a single degree of freedom. 
Note that these conditions may have different durations.

- DCM\_BS\_ITYPE\_COI \- the curve at the specified parameter value is constrained to pass through a particular point (as given by a 2D vector value). Removes 2 degrees of freedom.
- DCM\_BS\_ITYPE\_G\_COI \- the curve is constrained to pass through a given interpolation g\_node at the given parameter value. 
The g\_node must be specified at the corresponding position in the [interp\_g\_nodes](#interp_g_nodes) array and the corresponding vector in [interp\_vectors](#interp_vectors) is ignored. 
Removes 2 degrees of freedom.
- DCM\_BS\_ITYPE\_DERIV1 \- the first derivative vector is constrained to have the specified value (as given by the two doubles in the corresponding entry of the [interp\_vector](#interp_vectors) s array). Removes 2 degrees of freedom.

This may be used to specify "clamped" end conditions.
- DCM\_BS\_ITYPE\_DERIV2 \- the second derivative vector is constrained to have the specified value (as given by the two doubles in the corresponding entry of the [interp\_vectors](#interp_vectors) array). Removes 2 degrees of freedom.

This can be used to specify "natural" (zero second derivative) end conditions.
- DCM\_BS\_ITYPE\_CURVATURE – this interpolation condition appears in the DCM\_bs\_itype enum but is not currently supported.
- DCM\_BS\_ITYPE\_DERIV1\_DIR \- the curve is constrained to have the specified tangent vector direction at the given parameter value. 
Removes 1 degree of freedom.
- DCM\_BS\_ITYPE\_DERIV1\_LEN \- the curve is constrained to have the specified length of the first derivative vector at the given parameter value. 
Removes 1 degree of freedom.

Note that the DCM\_BS\_ITYPE\_DERIV1\_DIR and DCM\_BS\_ITYPE\_DERIV1\_LEN conditions must be used together, at the same parameter value.

### 16.6.3 DCM\_bs\_status - error code returned by spline functions

This error code is returned by the spline functions and can have the following values:

- DCM\_BS\_STATUS\_OK \- This will be returned if no errors were found.
- DCM\_BS\_STATUS\_NOT\_A\_SPLINE \- This will be returned if a non-spline g\_node is passed to one of the spline functions.
- DCM\_BS\_STATUS\_BAD\_DATA \- This will be returned if the application passes invalid spline data. 
For example, if too few points are passed given the degree of the curve.
- DCM\_BS\_STATUS\_OVER\_DEFINED \- This can be returned if the spline has too many interpolation conditions for the given number of control points (see [interp\_weights](#interp_weights)).
- DCM\_BS\_STATUS\_NOT\_SOLVED \- The DCM was unable to find a solution for the control point positions, which satisfies all the interpolation conditions. 
This is usually indicates that the spline has too many control points for the interpolation conditions (i.e. 
it is under-defined). In this case, the DCM may fail to solve the system of interpolation conditions if the initial control point positions are a long way from solution.

### 16.6.4 add\_spline\_g - Add a spline curve

g\_node\* add\_spline\_g( void\* ag, DCM\_bs\_data\* spline\_data, DCM\_bs\_status\* status );

Takes a pointer ag to an application geometry and the [DCM\_bs\_data](#DCM_bs_data) structure (which must be filled in by the application). Provided that data is consistent it will create a spline curve in the DCM and return its g\_node, and status will be DCM\_BS\_STATUS\_OK. 
If there are any errors the value of the g\_node will be NULL.

The DCM will copy the spline data, hence the application does not need to maintain this after the call.

### 16.6.5 update\_spline - Modify the definition of a spline curve

DCM\_bs\_status update\_spline( g\_node\* sgn, DCM\_bs\_data\* spline\_data );

Takes a pointer sgn to an existing spline curve and a [DCM\_bs\_data](#DCM_bs_data) structure. 
The application can use this to change the data that defines the curve. 
See above for details of the structure. 
Any constraints and dimensions to the curve will be preserved.

As for add\_spline\_g, DCM copies the data specified so the spline\_data struct is only required at the time of the call. 
The new spline\_data defined in this function is added to the existing spline data stored for the spline using a logical OR operation. 
This means that update\_spline may be used to:

- Specify new values for already defined spline\_data fields, or,
- Add new fields that were previously undefined.

The update\_spline function cannot be used to:

- Unset a previously defined data field.

The input spline\_data does not need to be a complete spline definition; only the fields being changed need to be defined, so long as the mask is set correctly to indicate to DCM that only those fields are to be read.

For example, you cannot change the rationality of a spline to non-rational, and then remove the data corresponding to the interpolation weights. 
If you wish to remove and element in this way, the required function is replace\_spline.

If the data is not valid the function will return DCM\_BS\_STATUS\_BAD\_DATA and the spline will not be modified.

When update\_spline is not being called from within a DCM Frustum function, the spline\_data may be set to NULL if the data is not changed but some of the defining control points have moved. 
This method might be used to cause the DCM to regenerate the spline shape due to a change in control point locations, without solving the constraints.

If the spline is modified (outside of a Frustum callback), the DCM partition containing the spline is reset (see [16.8.5 reset - Prevent an incremental evaluation](16.8._Model_evaluation.md)
See section [2.5.3 Incremental evaluation](2.5._Evaluating_the_model.md)

This function can also be called recursively when the Frustum function DCM\_spline\_update is called. 
In this case the DCM will specify which data can be changed and the DCM data will not be reset and an incremental evaluation is possible. 
Note that the DCM will not check if the defining control points have been moved after update\_spline is called from within a Frustum function – this behaviour is not supported.

### 16.6.6 replace\_spline - Modify the definition of a spline curve

DCM\_bs\_status replace\_spline(g\_node\* sgn, DCM\_bs\_data\* spline\_data);

Takes a pointer sgn to an existing spline curve and a [DCM\_bs\_data](#DCM_bs_data) structure. 
The application can use this to change some or all of the data that defines the curve. 
See above for details of the structure. 
Any constraints and dimensions to the curve will be preserved.

The input DCM\_bs\_data structure will entirely replace the data of the existing spline curve. 
This means that the input DCM\_bs\_data structure should define the spline fully, using the same inputs that would be used in add\_spline\_g. 
This differs from the behaviour of the function update\_spline which allows only limited modifications.

If the data spline\_data is not valid the function will return DCM\_BS\_STATUS\_BAD\_DATA and the spline will not be modified.

This function can be called by the application whenever the DCM is not performing a solve (e.g. 
evaluate, move\_and\_evaluate).

Additionally, the function may be called from within the Frustum function DCM\_spline\_update during a call to move\_and\_evaluate when the input mask indicates that this is expected by setting the mask bit DCM\_BS\_DEGREE. 
Note that DCM will only call DCM\_spline\_update to offer the application the opportunity to fully redefine the spline if the spline g\_node is included in the geometry to be moved by move\_and\_evaluate. 
See [16.8.3 move\_and\_evaluate - Evaluate preserving chirality](16.8._Model_evaluation.md)

If the spline is modified by this function (except from with the DCM\_spline\_update Frustum function), the DCM partitions containing the spline, and any associated geometry such as new control or interpolation points are reset and this will prevent incremental evaluation if re\_evaluate is called. 
See section [2.5.3 Incremental evaluation](2.5._Evaluating_the_model.md)

### 16.6.7 enquire\_spline - Enquire the properties of a spline

DCM\_bs\_status enquire\_spline( g\_node\* sgn, DCM\_bs\_data\* spline\_data );

Takes a pointer sgn to an existing spline curve and a [DCM\_bs\_data](#DCM_bs_data) structure. 
The application fills in the data\_mask argument in the structure to show which fields should be filled in by the DCM. 
In some cases it may be necessary to call this function twice, once to get the size of the arrays needed for control points, etc. 
Note that the application may need to calculate the array lengths depending on the type of spline.

### 16.6.8 transform\_spline - Rigidly transform a spline

DCM\_bs\_status transform\_spline( g\_node\* sgn, double mat \[3\]\[3\] );

Takes a pointer sgn to an existing spline curve and a transformation matrix mat. 
The curve will be moved rigidly. 
If the curve is defined using control points or interpolation points then the application will also need to move these.

Note that this function will not attempt to satisfy any constraints to the curve or the points.

Using this function is equivalent to transforming the points or data used to define the spline without evaluating the model.

### 16.6.9 spline\_parameter\_limits - Enquire the parameter limits of a spline

DCM\_bs\_status spline\_parameter\_limits( g\_node\* sgn, double\* min, double\* max );

Takes a pointer sgn to an existing spline curve. 
Returns the parameter limits of the spline in min and max.

### 16.6.10 spline\_discontinuities - Return discontinuities

DCM\_bs\_status spline\_discontinuities( g\_node\* sgn, int nth\_der,

      int\* n\_discons, double\* discons );

Takes a pointer sgn to an existing spline curve and an argument nth\_der that is the derivative of interest. 
Returns n\_discons the number of discontinuities of the nth\_der derivative, and an array of their parameter values.

Normally, an application will call this function once with the value of discons set to NULL in order to find the number of discontinuities, and then call it again with an array of the appropriate length.

Note that this function will only identify discontinuities that are a result of repeated knots. 
It will not identify any that may result from the current position of the control points.

### 16.6.11 spline\_evaluator - Enquire the position and derivatives on a spline

DCM\_bs\_status spline\_evaluator( g\_node\* sgn, double t, int n\_der,

    DCM\_discontinuity\_side side, double\* c\_array );

Takes a pointer sgn to an existing spline curve, t which is a parameter value on the curve, n\_der which is the number of derivatives required and side which indicates which solution is required at a discontinuity. 
The function returns an array of points and derivatives in c\_array.

If n\_der is zero, only the position will be returned and so the application must allocate an array of length 2. The array length must be 2\*(1+n\_der).

The argument side is only used if enquiring data at a discontinuity on the curve. 
It can either be DCM\_DS\_LOWER to get the curve details on the side of the decreasing parameter value, and DCM\_DS\_UPPER to get the curve details on the side of the increasing parameter value. 
If the curve has no discontinuities, or t is not at a discontinuity, the value of side is ignored.
