## 10.1 Operations on Conic curves

The DCM allows the application to do the following:

- Create a conic curve using any suitable combination of data.
- Enquire the data that defines an existing conic curve.



The application can choose which data is returned. 
For example, it can choose to only enquire the current rho value.
- Re-define a conic curve, while still preserving all existing constraints to the curve.



It is possible for the application to only update certain data. 
For example, it is possible to change the rho value but to leave all other data unchanged.
- Enquire the properties of the underlying conic section (e.g. 
focus, axis direction).
- Move a conic rigidly by applying a transform.
- Call a parametric evaluator function for the conic curve.

Details of these are given in the following sections, and in section [16.7 Conic functions](16.7._Conic_functions.md)
