## 10.5 Limitations on conics

In the current version of DCM there are certain limitations on the Conic geometry type that may be removed in future versions:

- Only shape changing modifications of conic curves are supported in move\_and\_evaluate. 
These are modifications to rho and, where applicable, control vector positions. 
This means that updates to other conic properties, such as its g-nodes, its type, or, where applicable, its SHAPE are not supported by move\_and\_evaluate..
