## 10.2 NURBS representation

A bounded conic section as defined in DCM can be represented exactly using a specific NURBS curve. 
DCM takes advantage of this by using similar functions to those for DCM splines, so that applications can easily map to a spline representation of the curve.

The NURBS representation is a rational quadratic Bézier curve, with a fixed knot vector of \[0,0,0,1,1,1\] and the control point weights as follows:

Although rigid curves of this form can be added using the DCM spline type, that type is unsuitable for representing flexible conic s because the ρ (rho) value which defines the shape would not be considered a freedom of the spline. 
Additionally, if a conic curve is defined via the DCM spline interface then DCM would not be aware of the properties of the underlying conic section (e.g. 
the axis and foci).

The DCM conic type has the ρ parameter as an internal degree of freedom. 
DCM is also aware of the properties of the underlying conic section, which allows an appropriate direction for the curve.

All parametric curves in 2D DCM are directed geometries: The direction of a DCM conic is defined to be parallel to the axis of the underlying conic section. 
The direction is positive in the direction moving from the conic vertex (where the axis intersects the underlying curve) to the focus. 
Generally, this is in the direction of the opening of the bounded curve. 
Where the control point is a equidistant to the end points (symmetric control polygon) the direction reduces to that of the symmetry axis of the end points for parabolas and hyperbolas. 
For ellipses with a symmetric control polygon the direction is either that of the symmetry axis of the end points or is normal to it (depending on ρ, see note below). For non-symmetric control polygons the conic direction is a more complicated function of the control point positions and rho.

Note: For ellipses, the Bézier conic definition means that the direction of the curve is discontinuous in certain cases:

- For non-circular ellipses, the direction sign flips at the point where the control vertex passes through the line of symmetry between the end-points. 
This is because the direction of conics is always bounded between the line from start to end-point, and the line perpendicular to this curve from the control vertex towards the curve.
- It is possible for the underlying ellipse (0 < ρ < 0.5) of a DCM conic to be a circle. 
In DCM terms, this can occur at a particular ρ value when the control polygon is symmetric. 
This value of ρ depends on the positions of the control points.The direction of a circle is indeterminate and therefore, in this case, the direction of the conic is given the direction of the line connecting the apex point of the conic, and the mid-point of the line connecting the start and end-points. 
Note that this may cause discontinuous behaviour of the direction when changing the shape of a conic to or from a circular ellipse to a more general shape.
