# 10\. Conics

A conic section is a curve defined by the intersection between an infinite cone and a plane. 
They may be open, unbounded curves (hyperbolas and parabolas), or closed curves (ellipses and circles). The standard equation of a conic section is

Conic sections are commonly used in CAD systems, as they result in aesthetically pleasing edges with a varying curvature. 
They may be modelled as complete conics by using the standard equation or more commonly as bounded curves representing a portion of the complete conic. 
The complete conic is either one (a parabola) or two distinct (a hyperbola) infinite branches, or a closed curve (i.e. 
an ellipse). When modelling a bounded region it is usual to limit the arc to a single branch.

The DCM conic geometry type is currently implemented as a bounded curve defined by two end-points a control point and a shape parameter ρ (rho). The curve is tangent to the lines from the end-points to the control point. 
The DCM conic can therefore represent a limited portion of a conic section. 
Such conics may represented exactly as a Bézier curve (a form of NURBS curve).

The shape parameter, ρ (rho), is bounded in the range 0 < ρ <1.The control point lies off the curve at a position where the lines tangent to each end point intersect. 
The value of ρ defines what type of conic (hyperbola, parabola, or ellipse) is represented.

The proportion of the complete conic section that can be represented by the DCM curve type is limited only by three factors:

- The curve must fit within the size box specified for the DCM (angular resolution / linear resolution) for the resolutions to be valid.
- The curve must be geometrically continuous – therefore it may include only one branch, (or nappe), of a hyperbola.
- The requirement is for the end tangents to meet in a specific manner, which means that on an elliptical conic the bounded curve will always be less than half of the whole curve (Two points separated by π radians around a conic will have parallel tangents and so cannot be represented using the DCM conic definition. 
For any larger arc angle, the tangents diverge in the direction in which the curve is defined).

The parameter ρ is equal to the distance from a line between the two end-points to the furthest point on the curve divided by the distance from this line to the control point. 
A higher ρ value generally implies a curve with a higher maximum curvature (For certain cases, e.g. 
an elliptical arc, extreme curvatures can be generated near the ends with a small ρ value). The precise value of ρ determines the mathematical form of the curve:

- 0 < ρ < 0.5, the curve is an elliptical arc.
- ρ = 0.5, the curve is a parabola.
- 0.5 < ρ < 1, the curve is a hyperbola.
- Values within resolution of 0 and 1 are not supported as they represent degenerate cases: As ρ tends towards 0 the curve flattens and appears to become a straight line. 
As ρ tends towards 1 it tends towards two linear sections with a tangent discontinuity at the control point.



With default options, DCM solves can result in solutions with ρ exactly 0 or 1. Additionally, degenerate cases can occur for certain relative positions of the control points.



However, DCM provides an option that can be set so that it will not solve conics for values within the resolution of 0 or 1, or with badly positioned control points, so that the curve will never actually become linear, nor have a discontinuity. 
See [16.2.4.14 Control solving status for degenerate conics](16.2._Configure_global_DCM_behaviour.md)

Since ρ is an internal freedom the conic can change between the three conic types in response to the constraint scheme when DCM solves the model.

Note that when the shape is a hyperbola, a conic section has two branches because the plane intersects with both half-cones. 
In DCM the conic type only models a bounded region on a single branch.
