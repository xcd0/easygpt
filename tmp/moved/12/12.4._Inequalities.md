## 12.4 Inequalities

It is also possible to ask the DCM to find a solution in the presence of inequalities. 
An inequality is used to specify a range for a variable, and the DCM will attempt to find a solution such that the variable lies within this range.

Inequality solving in 2D DCM has significant limitations: Solving of models with multiple inequalities is more likely to fail and will usually be significantly slower, with worse scaling properties, than solving of all other DCM constraints. 
For this reason, the current inequalities functionality is considered deprectated, new customers are advised to avoid using it.

A completely new implememntation of inequalities is under development and a technical preview of this functionality is now available in the main 2D DCM release. 
However, customers need to contact D-Cubed support for information on how to enable that functionality.

### 12.4.1 Legacy inequalities

If a variable is used in an inequality, then it is possible to specify that the variable is greater than or equal to a numerical value, less than or equal to a numerical value, or both. 
Hence, an inequality will specify one of the following:

min <= v1

v1 <= max

min <= v1 <= max

The most common reason why an inequality is used is when there are several different ways in which the DCM may change the model, and an application wants to make sure that the solution does not change particular dimensions beyond certain limits.

The DCM is only able to solve relatively simple cases where two or more inequalities interact. 
Additionally, it is not possible to solve a model that contains both dependence constraints and inequalities. 
It may also not be possible to drag a model containing inequalities reliably. 
For these reasons applications should only use inequalities in the DCM if the desired behaviour cannot be achieved in another way.

In many cases an application will only need to ensure that certain values are not exceeded when a model is evaluated.

### 12.4.2 Experimental linear inequalities

In version 73, access is provided to an initial implementation of a completely new solving system for inequality expressions. 
This functionality is intended as a full replacement for the inequalities previously provided in 2D DCM.

The new inequality system uses a different interface, which aligns 2D DCM more closely with both the equation interface and in turn the 3D DCM inequality interface. 
The main difference between the old and new interfaces is that a single e\_node representing an inequality defines a single limit. 
In addition, there is scope to support for inequalities which combine multiple variables in a linear expression with a single limit, in future.

In addition, new inequalities must be rigid \- that is, the constant and coefficient values (which effectively means the limits) cannot change during incremental solves. 
This restriction is in place to allow optimisation of solving of inequalities in models. 
A future non-rigid inequality could in theory be added, if there was demand.

In the new system, inequalities take the form of a linear expression:

ax \+ k >= 0

For future use, the interface supports the more general form:

ax \+ by \+ c + â€¦ + k >= 0

In version 73, only a single variable can be added to the inequality. 
Attempts to add a second variable to an inequality will be rejected.

This interface can be used to support general expressions, for example:

v => 7 is added as 1\*v - 7 >=0

v <= 7 is added as -1\*v + 7 >= 0

v > 0 is added as v - resolution >=0

For a linear variable, use linear resolution, for angles, use (linear resolution / size) as the angular resolution.

3 <= v <= 4 is added using two inequalities, 1\*v - 4 >= 0 and -1\*v +3 >= 0

For angular variables, the inequality constant is in radians. 
DCM supports radian values in any range, so it is important to note that a variable angle could take negative values and values greater than 2![](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Inequalities.png).

Also note that two DCM angle dimensions between the same geometries may be measuring in different ranges. 
So that when specifying equations and limits on the variables concerned it is important to use the same variable in the equations and inequalities.

When variable distance dimensions are used in inequalities, it is recommended to use help points wherever applicable, since variable distances are signed.

Whilst the new system is expected to dramatically improve the functionality of inequality solving with 2D DCM, it is expected tha the performance characteristics of models containing inequalities will not match those of traditional DCM models with only explicit constraints. 
Applications are advised to use inequalities sparingly.
