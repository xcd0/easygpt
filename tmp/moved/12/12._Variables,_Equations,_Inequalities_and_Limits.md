# 12\. Variables, Equations, Inequalities and Limits

The DCM is able to solve linear or non-linear equations and inequalities to find the values of variables. 
These can be used by the application to represent relationships that exist in a model.

Non-linear equations may also contain geometry and parameter nodes. 
This facility can be used to represent advanced constraints and dimensions that are not supported directly by the DCM. 
For example an application can constrain the area or perimeter length of a profile (see section [12.3 Uses of geometry and p\_nodes in non-linear equations](12.3._Uses_of_geometry_and_p_nodes_in_non-linear_equations.md)

This chapter also describes the use of application limits, which are an alternative to using DCM inequalities. 
Inequalities are solved numerically and their use may slow down the DCM significantly. 
Limits take the form of a maximum value, minimum value or both. 
These are stored in the application's model and their value is checked by the application following an operation to see if they are still valid before applying the changes suggested by the DCM. 
The Analyse user interface demonstrates how limits can be used in an application.
