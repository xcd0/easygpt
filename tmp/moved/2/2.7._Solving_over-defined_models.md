## 2.7 Solving over-defined models

In many models, the application will specify more than the minimum required number of dimensions or constraints. 
In certain cases the DCM will ignore redundant constraints and solve the model. 
In other cases it will mark parts of the model as over-defined. 
The sections below describe the cases that will be solved in more detail.

The descriptions below refer to consistent constraints and dimensions. 
Dimensions are said to be consistent if their values are satisfied by the position of the geometries.

### 2.7.1 Over-dimensioned models

The DCM will mark a dimension as over-dimensioned if it is not possible to vary the value of the dimension independently of other dimensions and still find a consistent solution. 
For further details see section [14.5 Over-defined status](14.5._Over-defined_status.md)

### 2.7.2 Over-constrained but consistent models

The DCM is able to solve consistent over-constrained situations that are caused by logical constraints rather than dimensions with values.

As discussed in section [6.2 Implied constraints](6.2._Implied_constraints.md)
The model will typically be over-constrained when these constraints are taken into account. 
The analysis of over-constrained but consistent cases also takes these inferred constraints into account. 
Note that constraints are not inferred between frozen geometries.

It should be noted that the number of over-constrained but consistent cases that can be constructed is unlimited. 
The common cases are all correctly managed in an efficient manner, but more complex examples may reduce performance. 
Hence, although applications can in principle use any consistent combination of constraints it is recommended that care is used when deciding what constraints to add to a model.

The list below describes cases that will be solved efficiently by the DCM and gives advice about which configurations should be avoided. 
In particular, see comments given below concerning the symmetric, midpoint and equal distance constraints.

- Multiple constraints between the same geometries. 
For instance, two circles can have several tangent constraints between them.
- Multiple coincident constraints between geometries of the same type. 
For instance, three points can each be made coincident to the other two.
- Multiple coincident constraints between lines and points. 
For instance, two bounded lines can be made coincident, and their endpoints can be made coincident with the other line.
- Parallel and perpendicular constraints. 
Any combination of parallel and perpendicular constraints will be reduced to the minimum set required, and any excess ones will be ignored. 
Note that a distance dimension between two lines is treated as a parallel constraint, except that it will never be one of the constraints that is ignored. 
The status codes of implied parallel constraints can be controlled using the option DCM\_OPKEY\_USE\_WORST\_PARTIAL\_STATUS.
- Offset profiles. 
Two profiles can be offset from each other with equal distance constraints. 
Constraints (e.g., tangency) between the geometries of one profile can be duplicated on the other profile.
- Equal radius constraints. 
The presence of equal radius constraints may make other constraints redundant. 
For example, any number of equal radius constraints can be applied between three or more circles.
- Pattern constraints. 
Only a limited number of over-constrained but consistent cases involving pattern constraints are efficiently managed by the DCM. 
These are sufficient to allow pattern constraints between multiple instances of a simple profile. 
See section [15.7 Patterns](15.7._Patterns.md)
- Symmetric constraints. 
There are many configurations where symmetric constraints will make other constraints redundant. 
These are recognised by the DCM. 
For example, a bounded line is made from an unbounded line and two points that are constrained to be coincident to the line. 
If two bounded lines are made symmetric two of the coincidence constraints between the points and the lines are redundant.



The DCM will efficiently manage all redundant cases where a geometry is symmetric about two symmetry axes. 
If a geometry is symmetric about three or more axes, and the symmetry constraints are redundant, the DCM may not be able to solve the model efficiently. 
Note that this will be true even if the symmetries are not applied directly but are implied by other constraints in the model.
- Midpoint constraints. 
Midpoint constraints are between a point and either two other points or two lines. 
The DCM will efficiently manage many of the common over-constrained but consistent cases. 
These typically arise when a point is constrained to be the midpoint of a bounded line.



For example, if lines are constructed between the midpoints of opposite sides of a rectangle, the DCM will recognise that these lines are already parallel to the sides of the rectangle. 
Any excess parallel constraints will be ignored.



Note that the DCM will not in general efficiently manage cases where a point is made the midpoint between more than two other pairs of geometries.
- Equal distance constraints. 
Equal distance constraints are placed onto four geometries. 
The DCM will detect and manage many of the common over-constrained but consistent cases.



For example, if a parallelogram has equal distance constraints which make opposite sides have the same length, this implies that the sides are parallel. 
The DCM will ignore any extra parallel constraints.



Note that in general the DCM will not efficiently manage complex cases where several equal distance constraints interact.

### 2.7.3 Over-rigid models

The DCM can solve models containing sets which are constrained so that they fit exactly. 
These cases are termed over-rigid. 
The DCM will solve over-rigid models as long as they are consistent i.e. 
the sets are exactly the right size and only logical constraints and rigid dimensions are used to constrain the sets.

Figure 8: Over-defined dependent group

[Figure 8: Over-defined dependent group](#_Ref125183102) shows two rigid sets with a coincident constraint between two edges. 
The distance between the two sets is already defined by the sizes of the sets and adding the distance dimension will over-define the model. 
However, the DCM will solve the model if the dimension is defined as a rigid distance constraint and its value is consistent (see section [4.2 Rigid dimensions](4.2._Rigid_dimensions.md)
