## 2.6 Ambiguous models

Some configurations of geometry and constraints give rise to models where the solution required is ambiguous. 
The most common of these are described in this section.

### 2.6.1 Singular dimensioning schemes

A singular dimensioning scheme is one where geometry positions are in some way special because of the current values of dimensions in the system. 
This typically means that the individual degrees of freedom of geometry in the system would change if one or more dimension values were changed.

Singular dimensioning schemes should be avoided as they will make it difficult or impossible to remove all the freedoms of a system without removing an existing dimension or constraint. 
A singular dimensioning scheme means that a model cannot be easily solved for variations of each parameter value in the system (the dimensions with values) since the solution relies on some values having the same ratio (typically equality).

The degree of singularity is the number of singular dimension configurations in a model. 
A DCM function is provided to compute this value and to identify the constraints (d\_nodes, r\_nodes and e\_nodes) which are contributing to the singularity. 
The computation of the degree of singularity can be quite costly from the point of view of performance, therefore the application should resort to it only if the model is known to be pathological. 
For example, in the case in which the constraint balance is zero but some geometry is still under-defined.

Figure 6. Example of singular under-defined configuration

A typical example of such a configuration where multiple dimensions effectively act on the same freedom, when assigned specific values, is shown in [Figure 6. Example of singular under-defined configuration](#_Ref497313057). In this case, the model geometry comprises a circle and two points coincident to it. 
Setting the circle radius and placing a distance dimension between the two points should remove all freedoms for these three geometries (excluding a rigid transformation of all the geometry). By setting the value of the distance equal to the circle diameter though, the position of the points with respect to the circle will still be undefined. 
The model in [Figure 6. Example of singular under-defined configuration](#_Ref497313057) has a degree of singularity of 1, as there is one freedom on which multiple dimensions are acting.

### 2.6.2 Singular under-defined

Generally geometry will be well-defined when there are sufficient constraints acting onto it to remove all the freedoms of the geometry. 
For example, a line has two freedoms (one angle and one position), so it will be well-defined constrained to two fixed (or well-defined) points, since each constraint removes a single freedom.

In some cases, however it is possible that there may be enough constraints acting onto a geometry to remove the freedoms, but because of dimension values or geometry shapes, the geometry is still actually under-defined. 
When this occurs, it is not usually possible to remove the remaining freedom of the geometry by adding additional constraints: These will often result in an over-defined model.

Such geometry is termed singular under-defined. 
By this we mean that a special combination of dimension values (or parametric geometry shape, or the position of frozen geometry) means that it is under-defined, even though no more constraints can be added to it.

Note that for logical constraints (i.e. 
without a value), DCM can identify when multiple such constraints would act on the same freedom of the geometry, and handle these redundant cases if they are consistent. 
Therefore logical constraints alone will not generally result in singular under-defined geometry.

With dimensions, however, it is possible that the particular values of dimensions will cause two or more constraints to act on the same freedom of a geometry, such that it is singular under-defined. 
In such models, if the dimension values are changed, the geometry will become well-defined.

If an additional constraint is applied to the singular under-defined geometry, the DCM will usually identify the model as over-defined, because the DCM will only find a solution for a model if dimensions can be varied independently and this is not possible for most singular models.

#### 2.6.2.1 Example 1 - Singular configuration arising due to dimension values

The most common cause of singular under-defined geometry is when dimensions with values cause geometry to be coincident without a logical constraint representing that relationship. 
This often occurs when the model contains two equal dimension values.

A simple example of this would be a line that is coincident to two points, each of which is positioned by independent dimensions to fixed perpendicular axes. 
In general, such as model will be well-defined. 
The two freedoms of the line are removed by the 2 constraints to points. 
The two freedoms of each point are removed by two dimensions to fixed lines.

However, if the dimension values are equal, such that the positions of the points are computed to be identical, then the position of the line will be under-defined: It must pass through the position where both points are located, but it can still rotate around that point.

Therefore the constraint balance will be zero: 6 degrees of freedom defined by the geometry, 6 degrees of freedom removed by the constraints, zero rigid body freedoms remaining. 
The status of the line, however, will be under-defined.

In this circumstance, it is not possible to remove the remaining freedom from the model by adding an additional constraint. 
Instead, another of the constraints must be replaced, or the dimension values changed.

#### 2.6.2.2 Example 2 - Singular configuration arising due to parametric shape

Where geometry is constrained to a parametric curve, singular configurations can arise. 
In particular, if a parametric geometry has a region of zero curvature, then the status of the model may be different when constraints to geometry must solve at these locations due to other dimensions in the model (e.g. 
distances).

So a circle that is tangent to a parametric may be well-defined for most values of a distance that acts upon it, but where the distance forces the tangency to solve on a linear region of that parametric, it could have an under-defined status.

For singular under-defined geometry arising from parametric curve shape, it is usually possible to remove the remaining freedom by addition of a further dimension, assuming that the existing dimensions are unchanged.

### 2.6.3 Singular configurations and constraint balance

DCM can report on the overall constraint balance of a system of geometry and constraints. 
This can be used as an indication of how many more constraints may be required to fully define a system.

Models that contain geometry which is singular under-defined will result in a conflict between the global constraint balance and the individual geometry statuses, because certain constraints that are counted in the constraint balance will actually have no effect.

Models that are over-constrained due to logical constraints do not have this effect, because DCM will recognise the redundancy and discard these from the count of constraints acting in the model.

### 2.6.4 Zero diamonds

The simplest example of a zero diamond is a model with two points, two lines and four coincident constraints. 
Each point has two coincident constraints onto the two lines, and there are no other constraints. 
This model illustrated in [Figure 7: Example of a zero diamond](#_Ref359939762)(a) has two possible interpretations:

- The points are meant to be coincident, with both lines going through them. 
The angle between the lines is not controlled. 
This is illustrated in [Figure 7: Example of a zero diamond](#_Ref359939762)(b).
- The lines are meant to be coincident. 
The two points can be positioned anywhere along them. 
This is illustrated in [Figure 7: Example of a zero diamond](#_Ref359939762)(c).

If a model includes an equivalent configuration of points and lines the DCM will check for constraints which imply one or other of the above solutions. 
If none are found then the DCM will ask the application what is intended. 
The application can inform the DCM that the points should be made coincident, the lines should be made coincident or the DCM should use its built-in defaults.

The default behaviour of the DCM is to decide which configuration is intended by measuring the angle between the lines at the start of the evaluation. 
If this is less than 45Â° the DCM will assume that the lines should be made identical. 
Otherwise it will assume that the points should be made identical.

If the application applies constraints that specify which pair of geometries are identical, the DCM will use this irrespective of the angle between the lines. 
It is recommended that applications should do this to avoid unexpected results. 
Applying the constraints to the geometry will also improve the performance of the DCM.

Applications typically have more information available about the geometry than the DCM and so they can make a better judgement about how to resolve the ambiguity. 
Two examples are:

The two points passed are the end-points of an application edge. 
In this case, the application would generally wish to make the lines coincident to avoid creating a zero-length edge.
The two points passed back are initially geometry identical and they are not the ends of the same edge. 
In this case, selecting the points to be coincident may be more appropriate, regardless of the angle between the lines.
