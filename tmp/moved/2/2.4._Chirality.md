## 2.4 Chirality

An important concept for the DCM is the chirality of a dimensioning scheme. 
The word chirality comes from the Greek word chira for "hand". It refers to the "handedness" of the solution found by the DCM, i.e. 
which roots of the equations are used, and hence which solution will be returned.

Chirality determines the way that a geometry is positioned relative to the geometries to which it is dimensioned. 
A dimensioning scheme can often be satisfied by a number of different configurations which correspond to different chiralities. 
Unless it is instructed to do otherwise, the DCM will preserve the chirality of all geometries. 
However, it is possible for an application to request that the DCM change the chirality. 
Details of this are given in chapter [5\. Chirality](5._Chirality.md)

A simple example which illustrates chirality is two circles which are dimensioned to be tangent to one another. 
They can either lie side by side or with one inside the other. 
As mentioned above, unless instructed to do otherwise, the DCM will always evaluate a new configuration that has the same chirality as the original geometry.

Other examples of chirality include:

- A geometry (e.g. 
a point) with a distance dimension to a line. 
The chirality is determined by the side of the line on which the point lies. 
The "side" of the line depends on the line direction, and hence it is important that the application maintains the direction of lines in a consistent way.
- A point with distance dimensions to two fixed points. 
Solving this corresponds to intersecting two circles. 
This gives two solutions (in general) with two different chiralities.

It is important to realise that geometry in the DCM always has an original configuration which is used for deciding the chirality. 
The chirality can be altered by moving the geometry before evaluating. 
Chirality is only considered between geometries which are dimensioned with respect to one another. 
In [Figure 1: When the dimension is changed, the circle will move as shown](#_Ref455824823) above, if there was no tangency constraint between the circles the concept of chirality would not apply and they could change configuration.

Note that a model with N geometries may theoretically have up to 2N-1 solutions with different chiralities. 
An application cannot tell in advance which chiralities the DCM will need to know in order to solve the model. 
Thus, the only practical way to specify which solution is required is to use the initial geometry locations provided by the application.

In some circumstances it is possible for an application to use the DCM so that it "remembers" the chirality of a model while it is changed. 
This allows an application to move geometry without changing the chirality.
