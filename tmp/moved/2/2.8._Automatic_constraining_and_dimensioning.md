## 2.8 Automatic constraining and dimensioning

Typically, an application will allow a user to sketch geometry, and then to apply constraints and dimensions to it incrementally. 
The DCM provides support for an application that wants to automatically apply constraints or dimensions to a model. 
Typically, this will be required when geometry data is read into the application without any constraint information. 
It may also be required when a new geometry is created, to generate constraints to existing geometries.
