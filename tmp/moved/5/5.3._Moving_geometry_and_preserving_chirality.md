## 5.3 Moving geometry and preserving chirality

In some circumstances, the application may wish to move the geometry independently of the DCM, but to find a solution with the chirality corresponding to the original position of the geometries. 
The DCM is able to support this type of operation provided the procedure below is used.

The application should not move the geometry directly. 
Instead, it should call the DCM function move\_and\_evaluate with the appropriate transforms. 
The DCM will record the original chirality, transform the geometry according to the transformations supplied by the application and solve in the new location. 
This procedure will have to be modified if the application wishes to change the shape of a parametric curve rather than just to transform it rigidly. 
Full details are given in chapter [16\. The DCM Interface](16._The_DCM_Interface.md)

One important feature of this facility is that it will only deduce constraints between fixed geometries (and geometries in the same set) after they have been moved. 
This will avoid the problems described in section [2.5.3 Incremental evaluation](2.5._Evaluating_the_model.md)
