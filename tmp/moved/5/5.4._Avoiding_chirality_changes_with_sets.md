## 5.4 Avoiding chirality changes with sets

It is possible for an application to use the 2D DCM to model a hierarchical assembly structure. 
In a single-level assembly, this would be achieved by using multiple instances of the DCM to solve individual parts, and by using sets to represent an assembly of rigid parts in another DCM. 
Multi-level assemblies can be represented in a similar way.

In order to reposition the parts with respect to each other, it is sufficient to evaluate just the DCM that includes all of the sets. 
If a change is made to an individual part, the model can be updated by evaluating the DCM corresponding to this part, and then the DCM that includes the sets. 
However, this can sometimes give an undesired result. 
This will occur if the change of the dimension in the part is sufficient to change the chirality of a dimension between the part and another part.

[Figure 43: Preserving chirality with sets](#_Ref420987490) shows one example of how this can occur.

Several methods could be used to avoid this problem. 
The simplest is to modify the sequence in which the DCMs are evaluated so that the chirality of the assembly is not changed. 
The following sequence of operations will do this:

- Call the evaluate (or re\_evaluate) function for each of the DCMs that represent a single part. 
Do not transform the geometries, but instead record the values of the transformations.
- Call the move\_and\_evaluate function for the DCM that positions the sets, passing it the transforms found from the previous stage.

The Analyse user interface command Sets... Evaluate uses this technique.
