## 5.1 Changing chirality

As mentioned above (section [2.4 Chirality](2.4._Chirality.md)
In the majority of cases this is what is required, but it is possible for an application to request that a different solution is found, by calling the DCM function change\_chirality.

There are two types of chirality change that can be made by the DCM when this function is called. 
These are described separately below. 
Note that chirality changes only take effect when the model is evaluated. 
See section [2.5 Evaluating the model](2.5._Evaluating_the_model.md)

DCM function: [change\_chirality](16.8._Model_evaluation.md)

### 5.1.1 Inverting a distance dimension

The simplest change that can be made corresponds to inverting a distance dimension. 
For instance:

- If a point is dimensioned from a line, inverting the dimension will move the point to the other side of the line.

Figure 34: Changing the chirality of a line-point dimension

- If a line is dimensioned from a circle, inverting the dimension will move the line as shown below.

Figure 35: Changing the chirality of a line-circle dimension

Changes can also be made which do not correspond to a simple negation of the dimension. 
For example:

![fig33_dimension_chirality.bmp](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Changing chirality_2.png)

Figure 36: Changing the chirality of either dimension

Note that only distance dimensions or equal-distance constraints can be inverted in this way. 
Other types of dimension or constraints cannot be inverted.

If a distance dimension to a circle, an ellipse or a parametric is inverted, the dimension will still measure to the same position on the geometry. 
This is because the help point or help parameter is not affected. 
For instance:

![fig34_ellipse_chirality.bmp](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Changing chirality_3.png)

Figure 37: Changing the chirality of the dimension to the ellipse

To visualise how inverting the sense of a dimension will change a design, think of how the design will change when the dimension value is reduced down towards zero. 
Now imagine that the geometry will carry on moving in the same direction as the dimension value passes a minimum and increases again.

Note that the chirality can only be changed in this way if the dimension has a numeric value. 
The chirality of a variable distance dimension cannot be changed.

### 5.1.2 Modifying a circle help point

Another way in which the chirality may be changed is by modifying the location of the help point on a circle. 
Only a distance dimension to a circle, a tangent constraint to a circle or a coincident constraint between a point and a circle can be modified in this way. 
A distance dimension or tangent constraint between two circles can be modified with respect to either circle. 
Examples of this type of change are shown in [Figure 38: Changing the chirality of a dimension to a circle](#_Ref420912446) and [Figure 39: Changing the chirality of a tangent constraint onto a circle](#_Ref420912456). In each case the locations of help points are shown by small circles:

- Changing a distance dimension onto a circle:

![fig35_circle_dim_chirality.bmp](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Changing chirality_4.png)

Figure 38: Changing the chirality of a dimension to a circle

- Changing a tangent constraint between two circles:

![fig36_tangent_chirality.bmp](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Changing chirality_5.png)

Figure 39: Changing the chirality of a tangent constraint onto a circle

To visualise how this change will affect the geometry, think of the help point moving to the opposite side of the circle. 
Geometry will then be moved so that the dimension is satisfied.

Note that in all these cases the application need not use a help point. 
However, changing the chirality will have the same effect as if a help point was present.

### 5.1.3 Creating inconsistent designs by changing chirality

Changing the chirality of a dimension will attempt to return an alternative solution to the dimensioning scheme. 
In many cases, a solution with a particular set of chiralities may not exist with the given dimension values (mathematically, they are "imaginary"). Chirality changes are always reversible, and if a particular change gives an inconsistent solution it can be undone by making the same chirality change again. 
Alternatively, it may be possible to find a solution by changing several chiralities at the same time.

In a design which is well-defined, or nearly well-defined, it will be found that there are many chirality changes that can be made. 
However, only a small number of these will result in a consistent solution. 
Models which are under-constrained are normally easier to manipulate.
