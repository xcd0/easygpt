## 5.5 Models with ambiguous chirality

When the DCM evaluates a model the initial position of the geometry will be used to determine the chirality of the solution. 
However, in some cases the initial geometry positions do not define the chirality. 
For example:

- If a point has a distance dimension to a line (see [Figure 34: Changing the chirality of a line-point dimension](5.1._Changing_chirality.md)
However, if the point lies exactly on the line the chirality is ambiguous.
- If a line has a distance dimension to a circle (see [Figure 38: Changing the chirality of a dimension to a circle](5.1._Changing_chirality.md)
However, if the circle has a zero radius the chirality is ambiguous.

In these cases the DCM will attempt to choose the chirality that leads to a solution, or if either chirality will give a solution the DCM will use a default. 
If the solution found by the DCM is not the one that is required then the application is able to change it as described in section [5.1 Changing chirality](5.1._Changing_chirality.md)

Note that the DCM will always find the correct chirality when a zero radius circle is the results of creating an offset of a profile that contains a circle. 
See chapter [11\. Offset and copy curves](11._Offset_and_copy_curves.md)
