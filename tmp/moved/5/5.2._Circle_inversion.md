## 5.2 Circle inversion

It is possible to allow the DCM to invert the sense of circles, if this is required to solve constraints. 
Circle inversion effectively turns the circle ‘inside out’: all constraints move to the point on the opposite side of the circle and constraints which measured to the inside will now measure to the outside. 
Inversion is typically required if a constraint causes a circle radius to decrease such that it would become zero and then to continue to a negative value. 
Instead of setting the radius to a negative (i.e. 
impossible) value, the DCM can invert the circle so that it begins to increase in size again, with any constraints acting on the opposite sides. 
Alternatively, a constraint may cause a circle radius to increase such that it would approach infinity, at which point the circle may invert and the radius will begin to decrease.

[Figure 40: Circle inversion](#_Ref74134449) below shows the effect of a circle inverting to solve a change in dimension value. 
In this example, the horizontal line and the circle centre are fixed. 
This means that as the dimension value decreases from the initial value of 60, the radius of the circle will decrease to satisfy the constraints. 
The other geometry constrained to the circle will be moved accordingly. 
The middle picture shows the position of the geometry at a value of 45. With no circle inversion, there would be no solution for a distance dimension of less than 40, since this would require a negative radius circle.

When circle inversion is enabled, however, the DCM is able to invert the circle so that lower dimensions values do have a solution. 
The help point for the dimension is moved through the centre of the circle so that the dimension now measures to the bottom of the circle. 
The radius of the circle therefore now increases as the dimension decreases. 
Note that all the other constraints to the circle also now act on the position opposite their original locations, so that the dimension to the bounded line is now on the upper right of the circle and the line, which started on the inside of the circle is now on the outside.

Circle inversion is disabled by default but it can be enabled for all circles via the set\_option function or for individual circles via a Frustum function.

When a circle is inverted, the DCM notifies the application by calling the DCM\_circle\_just\_inverted and DCM\_circle\_inverted frustum functions. 
The DCM\_circle\_just\_inverted function is called at the end of a solve (or undo) if the circle is inverted compared to its state before the solve. 
The DCM\_circle\_inverted function is called at the end of a solve (or undo) if the circle is inverted compared to its original chirality when the DCM performed a full evaluate. 
Additionally, the transform status value returned by the transform enquiry will also indicate if a circle has just inverted (DCM\_CIRCLE\_JUST\_INVERTED), or if a circle is inverted with respect to the initial position (DCM\_CIRCLE\_INVERTED).

Note that if the application calls reset on the geometry, the DCM\_CIRCLE\_INVERTED  status will be cleared. 
Likewise, when undo\_evaluation is called, DCM will call the DCM\_circle\_just\_inverted function if the circle inversion state changes between the current and previoud model and the DCM\_circle\_inverted function if the end state of the circle is that inverted.

The following series of diagrams demonstrates when DCM will call the DCM\_circle\_inverted and DCM\_circle\_just\_inverted frustum functions:

The initial model contains two fixed lines and a circle. 
The circle is tangent to one line (a small circle has been used to represent the help point), and the centre of the circle is given a distance dimension to the other.

The distance dimension is reduced to 35 and an incremental evaluation is performed. 
This forces the circle to invert, which causes DCM\_circle\_just\_inverted\_function to be called. 
Since the circle is inverted compared to the initial model, DCM\_circle\_inverted will also be called.

An incremental evaluation is performed without modifying the distance dimension. 
The circle is still inverted relative to the initial model, therefore DCM will call DCM\_circle\_inverted.

![](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Circle inversion_2.jpg)

The distance dimension is increased to 65 and another incremental evaluation is performed. 
The circle inverts but is no longer inverted relative to the initial model, so only DCM\_circle\_just\_inverted\_function is called.

![](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Circle inversion_3.jpg)

The model is returned to the previous solve using UNDO\_TO\_PREVIOUS with undo\_evaluation. 
DCM\_circle\_just\_inverted\_function and DCM\_circle\_inverted are called.

![](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Circle inversion_4.jpg)

The distance dimension is returned to 65 units and full evaluation is performed. 
This full evaluation forces the circle inversion status to reset, so that DCM now returns circle inversion statuses relative to the previous solve. 
Both DCM\_circle\_inverted and DCM\_circle\_just\_inverted\_function are called.

It’s important for the application to recognise that the DCM will internally reverse the start and end points of a circular arc when inverted. 
The application can either reverse the direction of the circle, or reverse the start and end points to match the DCM.

Initial model has an anti-clockwise arc edge with a smooth tangency

We assume here that circle inversion is necessary because some of the points are fixed.

In this case if circle inversion is OFF the DCM would not solve the model.

No handling of inversion - (arc still anti-clockwise, cusp appears.

![](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Circle inversion_8.jpg)

Handle inversion by drawing arc edge in opposite direction (arc now clockwise)

![](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Circle inversion_9.jpg)

Handle inversion by swapping which points are the start & end (arc still anti-clockwise)

Figure 42: Effect of inversion on circular arcs

[Figure 42: Effect of inversion on circular arcs](#_Ref428459218) shows an example model where inversion is required. 
The initial position is shown on the left, and three possible application results are on the right. 
Note that all three represent the same DCM solution for the underlying circle and infinite line; the only difference is how the application handles the bounded geometry. 
The second and third results show that by changing either the arc drawing direction or start and end points on an arc DCM has labelled as inverted, a smooth cusp can be maintained.
