# 18\. The 2D DCM Headers

This chapter gives a description of what is in each DCM interface and Frustum interface headers.

dim\_sys.hxx– These files contain the definition of the component interface of 2D DCM for C++. The majority of this interface is the definition of the DCM2\_dimension\_system class and its member functions.

dim\_sys.h – This file contains the C-interface version of 2D DCM.

dcmtypes.hxx – This file contains definitions of the structures and enumeration types which are used to pass data between the application and 2D DCM.

frustum.hxx – This file contains the definition of the functions in the Frustum interface of 2D DCM. 
These are functions (some of which are optional) that are provided by the application and may be called by 2D DCM.

dcm\_op\_defs.h – This file lists the options to control 2D DCM behaviour. 
This file is optional, it is not included by any of the other 2D DCM header files and not required to build an application that uses 2D DCM.
