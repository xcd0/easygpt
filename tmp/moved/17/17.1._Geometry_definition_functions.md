## 17.1 Geometry definition functions

These Frustum functions make enquiries about the analytic geometries used by the DCM, i.e., points, lines, circles, ellipses and sets.

Where a Frustum function requires that the application returns a direction vector, there is no requirement that the vector should be normalised (i.e. 
of length one). However, it is not valid to return a vector whose length is zero.

Note that the application must not change the type of an entity once it has been created (e.g., the type of a geometry).

### 17.1.1 DCM\_g\_identify - Gives type of geometry

DCM\_g\_type DCM\_g\_identify( void\* ag );

Called with an application geometry pointer and returns the geometry type. 
The geometry types which may be returned are:

DCM\_POINT

DCM\_LINE

DCM\_CIRCLE

DCM\_ELLIPSE

DCM\_PARAMETRIC

DCM\_SPLINE

DCM\_CONIC

DCM\_SCALABLE\_SET

DCM\_UNI\_SCALABLE\_SET

DCM\_BI\_SCALABLE\_SET

DCM\_SET

The type DCM\_SPLINE should not be returned in this function, since spline g\_nodes are not added using the add\_g function, but using the separate interface function add\_spline\_g. 
Similarly, a DCM\_CONIC should be added using the function add\_conic\_g.

### 17.1.2 DCM\_point\_point - Return vector of point

void DCM\_point\_point( double pt\[2\], void\* ag );

Called with an application pointer to a point and returns the co-ordinates of the point.

### 17.1.3 DCM\_line\_point - Return vector on line

void DCM\_line\_point( double pt\[2\], void\* ag );

Called with an application pointer to a line and returns the co-ordinates of a position on the line.

### 17.1.4 DCM\_line\_direction - Return direction of line

void DCM\_line\_direction( double dir\[2\], void\* ag );

Called with an application pointer to a line and returns the line direction.

### 17.1.5 DCM\_circle\_center - Return centre of circle

void DCM\_circle\_center( double pt\[2\], void\* ag );

Called with an application pointer to a circle and returns the centre of the circle.

### 17.1.6 DCM\_circle\_radius - Return radius of circle

double DCM\_circle\_radius( void\* ag );

Called with an application pointer to a circle and returns the radius.

### 17.1.7 DCM\_circle\_allow\_zero\_radius – Permit circle to have zero radius

DCM\_allow\_zero\_radius DCM\_circle\_allow\_zero\_radius( void\* ag );

Called with an application pointer to a circle. 
The application should return whether this circle is permitted to have a zero radius. 
The return should be one of:

- DCM\_ALLOW\_ZERO\_RADIUS\_ON – The radius of this circle may be zero.
- DCM\_ALLOW\_ZERO\_RADIUS\_OFF – The radius of this circle must not be zero.
- DCM\_ALLOW\_ZERO\_RADIUS\_DEFAULT – The DCM will use the global setting for circles to determine whether this circle can have a zero radius. 
The default is ON, i.e. 
the circle may have a zero radius. 
This can be changed with the set\_option function.

If this function is not registered this is equivalent to always returning DCM\_ALLOW\_ZERO\_RADIUS\_DEFAULT.

### 17.1.8 DCM\_circle\_allow\_inversion – Permit DCM to invert circle

DCM\_allow\_circle\_inversion DCM\_circle\_allow\_inversion( void\* ag );

Called with an application pointer to a circle. 
The application should return whether this circle can be inverted by the DCM to solve constraints. 
The inversion of a circle is equivalent to giving the circle a negative radius. 
The return should be one of:

- DCM\_ALLOW\_CIRCLE\_INVERSION\_ON – The circle may be inverted.
- DCM\_ALLOW\_CIRCLE\_INVERSION\_OFF\_STRICT \- DCM will reject all circle inversions. 
Note that the DCM may not identify circle inversions if the model requires numerical solving.
- DCM\_ALLOW\_CIRCLE\_INVERSION\_OFF – DCM will reject ‘inversion through zero’, but will allow ‘inversion through infinity’. The Frustum will not notify if there has been an inversion through infinity.

Inversion through zero occurs when constraints cause a circle radius to decrease such that it would become zero, then to continue to a negative value. 
Instead of setting the radius to a negative (i.e impossible) value, the DCM will invert the circle so that it begins to increase in size again.

Inversion through infinity occurs when constraints cause the radius to increase such that it would become infinite, at which point the circle will invert and the radius will decrease.

The series of diagrams below should demonstrate these concepts:

![](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Geometry definition functions.jpg)

The model contains a circle that is tangent to a fixed line, while there is a distance dimension between the circle centre and another fixed line

As the distance dimension decreases, the radius decreases until it has zero radius

As the distance dimension decreases further, the circle inverts through zero and the radius begins to increase

![](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Geometry definition functions_1.jpg)

A distance dimension is applied between a fixed line and a point on a circle. 
The two other points on the circle are fixed.

As the distance dimension is reduced, the point moves between the fixed points and the radius approaches infinity

As the distance dimension is reduced further, the circle inverts through infinity and the radius begins to decrease

Figure 81: Inversion through zero and Inversion through infinity

- DCM\_ALLOW\_CIRCLE\_INVERSION\_DEFAULT – The DCM will use the global setting for circles to determine whether this circle can be inverted. 
The default is DCM\_ALLOW\_CIRCLE\_INVERSION\_OFF. 
This can be changed with the set\_option function.

If this function is not registered this is equivalent to always returning DCM\_ALLOW\_CIRCLE\_INVERSION\_DEFAULT.

### 17.1.9 DCM\_ellipse\_center - Return centre of an ellipse

void DCM\_ellipse\_center( double pt\[2\], void\* ag );

Called with an application pointer to an ellipse and returns the co-ordinates of the centre of the ellipse (the point where the major and the minor axes cross).

### 17.1.10 DCM\_ellipse\_direction - Return direction of an ellipse

void DCM\_ellipse\_direction( double dir\[2\], void\* ag );

Called with an application pointer to an ellipse and returns the direction of the major axis.

### 17.1.11 DCM\_ellipse\_major\_radius - Return major radius of an ellipse

double DCM\_ellipse\_major\_radius( void\* ag );

Called with an application pointer to an ellipse and returns the value of the major radius.

### 17.1.12 DCM\_ellipse\_minor\_radius - Return minor radius of an ellipse

double DCM\_ellipse\_minor\_radius( void\* ag );

Called with an application pointer to an ellipse and returns the value of the minor radius.

### 17.1.13 DCM\_scaling\_direction – Definition of uni- and bi-scalable sets

DCM\_scaling\_direction\_return DCM\_scaling\_direction(void\* ag, double dir\[2\]);

Called with an application pointer to a uni- or bi-scalable set. 
The function returns a direction as two-dimensional vector. 
There is only one possible return value in this release, which is DCM\_SCALING\_DIRECTION\_SPECIFIED. 
For a bi-scalable set, this is the first scaling direction. 
The second scale will always be orthogonal to this direction, so no second vector is required.

If a scalable set is rotated as a result of an evaluation, then the scaling direction will be rotated to be consistent with the new orientation, for the duration of that evaluation. 
For example, if a set has a scaling direction in the x direction, and the set is rotated by 90 degrees as a result of an evaluation, then the set will be able to scale in the y direction.

The scaling direction will often be derived from the direction of a directed geometry within 2D DCM. 
It may also be a direction which is not shared by a directed geometry, for example (0,1) or (1,0).

The scaling direction is supplied by the application through the frustum interface during every evaluation. 
If the scaling direction is not derived from a directed geometry within the uni-scalable set, then the application must ensure that the supplied scaling direction is consistent with any rotation of the uni-scalable set. 
For example, if a uni-scalable set has an initial scaling direction of (1,0) and is rotated by 90 degrees, then the application must ensure that the scaling direction is (0,1) during the next evaluation.

1.1.1 Note that this function is not called for spline curves with rigidity set to DCM\_BS\_RIGIDITY\_UNI\_SCALABLE or DCM\_BS\_RIGIDITY\_BII\_SCALABLE– applications must specify the scaling direction for a spline through the DCM\_bs\_data structure (see [16.6.1 DCM\_bs\_data – spline data structure](16.6._Spline_functions.md)
