# 17\. The Frustum Interface

The DCM shares the geometry and dimension data that is stored in the application. 
For reading and altering this data the DCM communicates with the application via a set of functions known as the Frustum interface. 
The functions are defined in the Frustum header file delivered with the systemThe Frustum interface is defined by a registry mechanism so that an application must provide only those Frustum functions that are required to use the functionality being used. 
Note that the Frustum functions have "C" linkage but can be written in either C++ or C.

As well as geometry and dimensions, the DCM also supports variables, equations and inequalities. 
Information about these entities is accessed using the Frustum interface in a similar way.
