## 17.8 Frustum functions for offset and copy curves

The following functions will only be called for offsets to ellipses or parametrics curves.

### 17.8.1 DCM\_offset\_orientation - Return orientation of the offset curve

DCM\_offset\_side DCM\_offset\_orientation( void\* off\_g, void\* parent\_g );

Called with the application pointer to an offset curve (off\_g) and the application pointer to the generating curve (parent\_g) and returns the orientation (or side) of the offset curve relative to the defining curve (a parametric curve or an ellipse).

The following diagram illustrates these concepts for an offset-parametric:

Figure 82: The orientation of an offset parametric curve

For an offset parametric, the offset orientation is DCM\_OFFSET\_LEFT or DCM\_OFFSET\_RIGHT and defines whether the curve lies to the left or the right of the tangent of the generating curve in the direction of increasing parameterisation. 
"Left" and "right" are always used in when referring to parametric curves regardless of whether or not the curve is closed or periodic.

For an offset ellipse, the side is DCM\_OFFSET\_INSIDE or DCM\_OFFSET\_OUTSIDE as appropriate.

### 17.8.2 DCM\_offset\_distance - Return the offset distance

double DCM\_offset\_distance( void\* off\_g, void\* parent\_g );

Called with the application pointer to an offset curve (off\_g) and the application pointer to the generating, parent, curve (parent\_g) and returns the offset distance. 
This distance should always be given as positive.

Note that this function and the preceding function are called to find the initial position of the offset curve at the start of an evaluation. 
This information is used to define the chirality of the solution, it is not a constraint on the resulting value of the distance between the curves.

### 17.8.3 DCM\_update\_offset\_data - Update the offset curve

void DCM\_update\_offset\_data( void\* off\_g, void\* parent\_g,

     DCM\_offset\_side o\_side, double offset, int mask );

This function is called if an offset curve is changed. 
The offset curve is off\_g and its generating curve is parent\_g. 
An offset curve may change in several ways, and the argument mask is a bit-mask which shows what has changed. 
It is the sum of the following values:

- DCM\_OFFSET\_SIDE\_CHANGED = 1 – The offset side has changed.
- DCM\_OFFSET\_DIST\_CHANGED = 2 – The offset distance has changed.
- DCM\_OFFSET\_PARENT\_CHANGED = 4 – The offset parent has changed shape.

In all cases, the current values of the offset side and distance are output. 
The distance is always positive, hence a new side and a positive distance will be returned instead of returning a negative distance and the original side.

Note that this contrasts with the output of the change in offset distance via the DCM transform function. 
In that function, the change in offset distance from the last solve/undo is output as a signed distance, observing the convention that the right side of an open loop is positive (the left is negative). For closed loops, positive is on the outside.

### 17.8.4 DCM\_copy\_transform – Return the copy curve transform

void DCM\_copy\_transform(void\* copy\_g, void\* parent\_g, double mat\[3\]\[3\]);

Called with an application pointer to a copy curve (copy\_g) and its parent (parent\_g) and returns the current transform of the copy curve.

### 17.8.5 DCM\_update\_copy\_transform - Update the copy curve transform

void DCM\_update\_copy\_transform (void\* copy\_g, void\* parent\_g, double mat\[3\]\[3\]);

The transform mat will be the transform required to move the current (solved) position of the original curve parent\_g to be identical to the current (solved) position of the copy curve copy\_g.

DCM never outputs an incremental change to the copy transform, it only outputs the full transform. 
If the transform between the original and copy curve has not changed during the solve, then this function is not called. 
This can be the case if both original and copy curve move if they are moved by exactly the same amount.

In addition to this function DCM will also call the DCM\_transform Frustum function for a copy curve if it moves during a solve. 
The transform returned from that function is the amount by which it has moved in the solve (e.g. 
evaluate). It has no relation to the copy-transform. 
So if both the original and copy curve move by the same amount, then the DCM\_transform function will be called on the copy curve but not the DCM\_update\_copy\_transform function.

When the shape of the original curve changes the shape of the copy will change in the same way. 
This may result in no change to the copy transform but a change to the copy that does not have a simple rigid transform. 
In that case, the function DCM\_transform will not usually be called.

Applications can update their geometry definition either:

- By first updating the position of the original curve, and then computing the new position of the copy using the copy transform, or
- By using applying the standard DCM transform output for the copy on that curve.

The application should be sure to avoid moving the copy curve by double the required amount by applying both changes. 
Note that the recommended method to update the curve is via the copy transform.
