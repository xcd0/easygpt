## 1.2 Using the DCM in an application

The DCM has the advantage that it is specifically designed as a module to be added into other software. 
Wherever possible the DCM uses non-iterative algorithms and hence it is very fast. 
In many cases it can support real time design animation. 
In addition, the time taken for an evaluation depends linearly on the number of geometries and dimensions, even for very large models.

The definition of the geometry and the dimensions are held in the application and accessed by the DCM via evaluator functions known as the Frustum interface. 
This minimises the amount of extra memory required by the DCM and means that the application retains control of its data.

An added bonus is that the DCM can be used to provide all the geometric calculation required by the application. 
All construction tasks, such as constructing a circle tangent to three other circles, can just be passed to the DCM.

The DCM is delivered as object modules and as uncommented source code if this is required for porting. 
A full description of the software structure of the DCM can be found in chapter [2\. Fundamental DCM Concepts](2._Fundamental_DCM_Concepts.md)
