## 1.6 Advice for integrators

The DCM is provided as a general-purpose component for working with two-dimensional data. 
The interfaces are very flexible and allow the product to be used in many different ways. 
The documentation contains recommendations for how the software should be used, and wherever possible the default behaviour has been chosen to suit a wide range of applications.

Regular new versions of DCM continue to be released with new functionality and improvements to existing features. 
With each release, breaking changes in the interface are avoided so that upgrades can be achieved quickly without changes to customer code. 
In certain cases, default behaviours may be changed, so that for some customers it is necessary to add a call to change an option value on creation of the DCM to preserve old behaviour.

Professional support services are available for new and existing users of the DCM. 
These include the provision of complete or partial training courses, and on-going assistance and advice. 
Users are encouraged to take advantage of these services.
