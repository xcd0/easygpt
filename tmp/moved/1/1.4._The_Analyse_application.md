## 1.4 The Analyse application

The Analyse application is a GUI implementation of the DCM that is supplied with the system in order to demonstrate some of the facilities offered by the package. 
It may be helpful to try out this interface before attempting to program with the DCM. 
The interface is described in the Analyse User Interface User Guide which is available in HTML format on the distribution, and as on-line help from within Analyse (Windows versions only). This guide includes some implementation details. 
The interface includes some more advanced applications of the DCM, which are described in the appropriate chapters of this manual. 
The Analyse user interface is supplied in executable form with commented source code.

The Analyse user interface incorporates many of the concepts that it would be necessary to put into other applications based on the DCM. 
For instance, it is possible to create a bounded line in a single operation. 
Within the DCM itself this is represented by an unbounded line, two points and two constraints between the points and the line. 
When using the Analyse interface it is important to distinguish between its behaviour and the functioning of the DCM itself. 
A version of Analyse is shipped that includes access to PGM functionality as well.
