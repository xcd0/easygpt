# 13\. Automatic Constraining and Dimensioning

The DCM includes functions that can be used to look for constraints and dimensions that may be applied to under-constrained geometry. 
These functions have been designed to be very flexible and to allow the application considerable control over the resulting dimensioning scheme.

There are many situations where an application may want to use these facilities:

- Data may be read in from an external source without any constraint information. 
Before allowing the user to change the model with dimensions, constraints can be applied automatically.
- The geometry in a model may be inaccurately defined, either because it comes from another system or because it has been "sketched" in. 
By applying constraints where appropriate and solving, it may be made more precise.
- An application may wish to provide users with a sophisticated automatic dimensioning facility. 
This could incorporate information about dimensioning standards.
- A user may want a quick and simple way to completely dimension a model, possibly followed by adding and removing dimensions manually in order to achieve the desired result.

The Analyse user interface includes commands that can be used to automatically apply constraints and dimensions to geometry. 
The way that they are implemented is described below. 
The implementation in Analyse is intended to illustrate possible ways of using the DCM. 
An application is free to use the DCM in other ways.
