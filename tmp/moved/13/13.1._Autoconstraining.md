## 13.1 Autoconstraining

The DCM provides support for an application to automatically apply constraints to geometry. 
Often, this will be required because geometry data is read into the application without any constraint information. 
It may also be required when a new geometry is created, to generate constraints to existing geometries.

When an application requests that the DCM search for constraints it supplies the DCM with a linear tolerance, an angular tolerance and the types of constraint to search for. 
The application can optionally provide the DCM with lists of geometries in order to specify what is required. 
These lists can specify one or more of the following:

- Geometries or sets that should be constrained to a specified region, or all, of the model.
- A region of the model to constrain.
- A list of preferred geometries to constrain to, e.g. 
reference axes.
- Types of directed geometries to consider when applying parallel and perpendicular constraints.
- A list of lines to use as axes for symmetry constraints.
- Pairs of geometries to use for equal distance constraints.

Further options allow the application to:

- Select the solving mode used for autoconstraining
- Provide an additional angular and linear movement tolerance which is used to internally reject constraints if they would cause the geometry to move too much. 
Generally this functionality is not required



This option is most useful with chains of geometries which all satisfy the linear and angular tolerances individually, but cause certain geometries to move larger distances or angles when solved. 
See section [13.1.3.2 Blocking constraints to avoid movement in the model](#_Ref428534320) for more details.

The DCM will find constraints based upon the position of the geometries and the resolutions specified by the application. 
It will take account of any constraints and dimensions that have already been applied to the model and so it will not find any constraints that cause the model to become over-defined. 
Note that this is different behaviour to the functions described in section [13.3 Constraint deduction](13.3._Constraint_deduction.md)
The exact function of autoconstrain can be modified by certain DCM options:

- DCM\_OPKEY\_AUTOCON\_HELP\_POINTS – Determines whether the DCM supplies help points with constraints to curved geometry. 
If supplied, they must be used by the application so this option should be set to OFF if the application does not use help points and ON if it does.
- DCM\_OPKEY\_AUTOCON\_CONSTRAINTS – Determines whether the DCM supplies the maximum number of constraints possible, using the DCM\_OPVAL\_AUTOCON\_MAX\_CONSTRAINTS value, or simply enough constraints to represent all the potential relationships that it identifies, using the DCM\_OPVAL\_AUTOCON\_MIN\_CONSTRAINTS value.
- DCM\_OPKEY\_AUTOCON\_V49 – Determines if the 2D DCM uses the autoconstrain algorithm as it was in version 49. The default is to use the new, much more efficient, algorithm, but customers requiring identical results may wish to use this option for older models.
- DCM\_OPKEY\_VER\_AUTOCON\_EQUIV\_CLASS – Determines which version of the autoconstrain algorithm the DCM will use. 
The default value isDCM\_OPVAL\_VER\_AUTOCON\_EQUIV\_CLASS\_CURRENT, and guarantees that the latest version of the algorithm is used.



Usingthe DCM\_OPVAL\_VER\_AUTOCON\_EQUIV\_CLASS\_67value, the autoconstrain algorithm guarantees for output equivalence classes that each member is related to all the other members of the class by less than the specified tolerance. 
The older behaviour, DCM\_OPVAL\_VER\_AUTOCON\_EQUIV\_CLASS\_66could sometimes create classes spanning more than the specified tolerance (see [13.1.2 Relationship between members of the same equivalence class](#_Ref475984954) for details). Using the option DCM\_OPVAL\_VER\_AUTOCON\_EQUIV\_CLASS\_66provides backward compatibility for applications that need to get the same results as in earlier versions.

The frustum function DCM\_autocon\_weight, if implemented, gives the user some additional control over the selection of constraints. 
It returns a weight, based on criteria of the end-users choosing, which biases how the constraint should be applied to the model. 
A negative weight is taken to mean "do not apply", and a positive weight indicates the preference for the constraint. 
Constraints with greater weights will be applied earlier during autoconstraining, and might displace less-preferred constraints.

The DCM will not apply the constraints to the model. 
Instead it will return information to the application in two forms:

- Equivalence classes. 
To reduce the amount of information output, the DCM will output a list of geometries for identical, parallel, concentric, equal radius and equal distance constraints. 
See section [13.1.1 Equivalence classes](#_Ref497197429) for details.
- Specific constraints. 
All other constraints are output individually.

It is expected that when the DCM outputs suggested constraints these will be applied by the application, calling add\_d. 
It is possible to reject a suggested constraint by not adding it when the Frustum function is called. 
DCM will then suggest alternative constraints. 
However, it is much more efficient to reject such constraints by supplying a negative weight to the DCM\_autocon\_weight function so that DCM will never output the unwanted constraints.

Notes:

- Pattern, equal relative transform and midpoint constraints are currently not supported.
- Constraints to parametrics should only be found if the curve is globally C1 continuous.
- Constraints will not be identified between elements within the same set.
- DCM will not enquire weights for constraints output as equivalence classes.

### 13.1.1 Equivalence classes

Equivalence classes are collections of geometry that all satisfy some geometric relationship. 
The DCM recognises five types of equivalence classes: identical, parallel, concentric, equal radius and equal distance. 
When searching for constraints the DCM will output a list of all of the geometries in an equivalence class. 
It will not output specific constraints between members of the class.

Note that identical equivalence classes contain geometry of the same type and in the same position and are output as coincidence constraints. 
All other equivalence classes correspond to specific constraints supported by the DCM.

The equivalence classes reduce the amount of information output by the DCM. 
For example, if two lines are identical (i.e. 
they are in the same identical equivalence class) they will also be in the same parallel equivalence class. 
However, only one of them will be referred to by the DCM when it deduces parallel equivalence classes. 
Similarly, if there are several lines in each of two parallel equivalence classes (as in [Figure 64: Example of two parallel equivalence classes](#_Ref497282245)), only a single perpendicular constraint will be output.

![fig56_equivalence.bmp](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Autoconstraining.png)

Figure 64: Example of two parallel equivalence classes

An identical equivalence class will affect what is output for all other equivalence classes and all specific constraints. 
A parallel equivalence class will affect the output of perpendicular constraints. 
In each case the DCM will choose a representative member of the equivalence class to output constraints.

An application is free to choose how to place constraints between members of an equivalence class and between equivalence classes. 
In fact, because the DCM will ignore any over-constrained but consistent configurations, it is possible to put all possible constraints onto the geometry.

Note that in a model that contains rigid sets any single equivalence class will include at most one geometry from each set.

### 13.1.2 Relationship between members of the same equivalence class

Using the current autoconstrain algorithm (version 67) DCM guarantees that any constraints applied are between geometry within tolerance specified, whether by distance or angle. 
Using version 66, chains of applied constraints could lead to two or more geometries separated by more than tolerance ending up constrained together.

[Figure 65 Example of equivalence class output in autoconstrain](#_Ref476134846) shows an example where autoconstrain is used to find identical equivalence classes and so to automatically apply coincident constraints. 
In this example, there are 4 points which could be made coincident by autoconstrain when looking for identical geometries. 
The distances between each pair are shown.

If the linear tolerance is 5.5 units, for example, then there are 4 pairs of points within that tolerance initially but these cannot be part of a single equivalence class, since the diagonal distances exceed the tolerance. 
The pairs of points circled indicate the two classes DCM will identify, based on picking the most closely grouped points whilst respecting the overall tolerances.

Figure 65 Example of equivalence class output in autoconstrain

For comparison, with the old version 66 algortihm, DCM would put points 1, 2 and 4 into a single class (and not constrain point 3) since it only required that each geometry added to the class was within tolerance of the first class member.

### 13.1.3 Automatic constraining

The application may need to consider the following points when using the autoconstrain function.

- By default, autoconstrain will supply help points for constraints to curved geometry. 
When help point values are supplied, they must be used by the application. 
Applications that do not use help points should set the DCM option DCM\_OPKEY\_AUTOCON\_HELP\_POINTS to OFF (see section [16.2.5.1 Return help point positions for automatic constraints to analytic curved geometries](16.2._Configure_global_DCM_behaviour.md)
- By default, autoconstrain is designed to minimise the number of constraints that need be added to fully define all the relationships that are found. 
This means that it will not suggest constraints between geometries when it detects that the constraint is already implied by other constraints and dimensions already on the model.



It is possible to alter this behaviour so that autoconstrain identifies the maximum number of constraints that can be applied, subject to the restriction that the model is not over-defined. 
The model will be over-constrained, however. 
For example, to force the DCM to return perpendicular constraints for all corners of a rectangle, the DCM must be asked to maximise the constraints return.



To control this behaviour, applications should use the set\_option function for the DCM\_OPKEY\_AUTOCON\_CONSTRAINTS option with the values DCM\_OPVAL\_AUTOCON\_MIN\_CONSTRAINTS (the default) or DCM\_OPVAL\_AUTOCON\_MAX\_CONSTRAINTS. 
N.B. 
this option will not affect the number of geometries that are identified in equivalence classes – the DCM will always list the full set of mutually parallel lines, for example.
- The DCM will find constraints between unbounded geometry. 
However, an application may only be interested in constraints between the bounded parts of the geometry. 
For example, the DCM may find a tangency between a line and a circle, but an application may decide to reject it because it only wants tangencies to the bounded part of an arc.
- The DCM is optimised for the case where the application adds all constraints recommended by the DCM. 
Rejecting many constraints can make the algorithm slow. 
The DCM\_autocon\_weight Frustum function should be used to filter out unwanted constraints between pairs of geometries if possible, since rejecting constraints at this point (by giving a negative weight) is not expensive.
- Constraints output by equivalence classes cannot be ranked using weights (DCM\_autocon\_weight is not called for these constraints). These are always considered higher ranking than non-equivalence constraints. 
Note that it is possible to apply fewer than the required constraints within DCM\_automatic\_class - i.e. 
when adding constraints the application is permitted to split an equivalence class up or indeed to apply none of the constraints.
- On a large model there may be many possible constraints. 
Many of these will be discarded but each of them needs to be looked at.
- The autoconstrain function does not move geometry. 
So, although constraints will have been applied according to the resolutions specified when the function is called, they may not be satisfied to the accuracy of the DCM. 
It is recommended that that application should evaluate the model after calling autoconstrain.
- Equal distance constraints are only applied between appropriate pairs of geometry that are passed to the function. 
Typically these pairs may represent the endpoints of lines (in which case the DCM will attempt to constrain the lines to have the same length) or pairs of geometry in two offset profiles.

#### 13.1.3.1 Selection of directed geometries to consider while autoconstraining

As documented in section [3.2 Classification of geometry](3.2._Classification_of_geometry.md)
The DCM can infer parallel or perpendicular constraints to these geometry types during autoconstrain.

An option to the autoconstrain function can be used to control which types of directed geometries should be considered. 
To use this, the application must use the DCM\_AUTOCON\_VERSION\_2 option and set a bit-mask that specifies directed geometry types to constrain. 
See [16.11.1 autoconstrain - Automatically generate constraints](16.11._Autodimensioning_and_autoconstraining.md)

#### 13.1.3.2 Blocking constraints to avoid movement in the model

Since autoconstrain will add constraints using a separate tolerance to the resolution values used in solving, it is entirely possible that geometry will need to move to solve the newly added constraints. 
This is of course particularly likely if the tolerance values used are larger than the DCM resolutions. 
It should be noted that DCM autoconstrain will not move the geometries (i.e. 
it will not output transforms, though during the process parametric geometry may be regenerated temporarily to different positions). Therefore, constraints added may not be satisfied at the end of the autoconstrain function. 
It is also possible to call autoconstrain on a model which has unsatisfied constraints initially added by the application.

Typically the motion expected will be of the order of the size of the input tolerances (assuming a satisfied model to begin with). However, it is possible to find that the amount that geometry moves is significantly larger, due to multiplication effects. 
There is no direct relationship between the tolerance values being used to find candidate constraints and the likelihood of large motion being caused.

The solving mode used in the subsequent evaluate will have an effect, however, on the chance of large motion occurring – minimum move solving will typically give less chance of a large motion compared to standard solving, for example.

[Figure 66: Autoconstrain linear and angular movement tolerance](#_Ref428546796) demonstrates the use of the linear and angular movement tolerance. 
If the distance between the points is less than the linear tolerance, or the angle between the lines is less than the angular tolerance, then autoconstrain would identify coincident constraints between the points in the former and parallel constraints between the lines in the latter. 
However, if these constraints are applied, the distances or the angles can accumulate and cause certain geometry to move much larger distances or angles to satisfy the constraints.

![](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Autoconstraining.jpg)![](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Autoconstraining_1.jpg)

Figure 66: Autoconstrain linear and angular movement tolerance

The autoconstrain function therefore provides an optional mode to check movement of geometry during constraint analysis. 
This takes additional tolerances which can be larger than the tolerance for detection of candidate constraints (it can also be smaller, but this is not recommended since it will be less efficient than setting the search tolerance to the smaller value as well, which should have the same effect).

When checking for movement, instead of simply checking the basic infinite geometry, DCM uses a set of heuristics to attempt to consider only changes an application would find interesting. 
There is scope for alternative heuristics to be added under different "levels" of checking in future.

The current heuristics attempt to identify whether any bounded curves, including linear, arc and elliptical edges will move more than the limit. 
This means, for example that movement of the centre of a circle by more than the limit can be permitted, if a bounded arc on the circle would not itself move by too much. 
Frequently an arc will be limited to only a tiny part of a circle, and a small change in the arc would give a very large transform on the circle centre.

The following tests are used:

- No points move by more than the linear tolerance, except for circle centre points.

- Circle or ellipse centres are defined the same as any points constrained identical to a circle centre and not constrained to any other geometry. 
So they may be concentric to the circle or coincident to a point which is concentric to it.

- For lines, attempt to identify if they represent a bounded linear edge:

- A bounded edge is inferred if there are 2 or more distinct points coincident to the line. 
A bounded line is only considered to move too far if its bounding points move too far.
- A non-bounded line will be checked to see if the angular change exceeds the specified angular movement tolerance or if the position moves by more than the linear tolerance.

- For arcs and ellipses, attempt to identify if they represent a bounded edge.

- A bounded edge is inferred if there are 2 or more distinct points coincident to the circle/ellipse. 
If so, autoconstrain allows a circle transform if all positions on one potential bounded edge would be moved by less than the linear tolerance.
- If the conditions for a bounded arc are not met, any movement of any part of the geometry, including its centre, by more than the linear tolerance will cause constraints to be rejected.

- Splines are checked to see if any position moves by more than the linear tolerance.
- Evaluated parametric curves and conic curves are not currently checked (aside from the checks on their defining geometry).

### 13.1.4 Autoconstraining in the Analyse user interface

The Autoconstrain... menu has commands that will apply constraints to geometry using the DCM autoconstrain function. 
The commands on this menu allow the user to exercise the autoconstrain function by applying selective constraints or applying constraints in a defined sequence described in the next section.

#### 13.1.4.1 Autoconstraining model sequence

The Analyse command Autoconstrain model is intended as an example of how constraints may be added in an automated way. 
When calling the autoconstrain function the Autoconstrain model command will use the lists of preferred geometry and symmetry axes if they have been specified. 
For some constraint types it will not add a constraint if it is not found within the bounded region of a geometry. 
The sequence of constraints added is as follows:

- For all model geometry:

- Identity, Symmetry, Concentric, Parallel, Perpendicular, Equal radius and Equal distance

- Limiting allowed matches to bounded regions of geometry:

- Coincident
- Taking each profile (polyline) individually - Tangent constraints
- Any further tangent constraints on the model as a whole
- Normal constraints

It is recommended that an application should experiment with typical model data to find a suitable procedure.

#### 13.1.4.2 Applying constraints while sketching

Another way an application can automatically apply constraints is by adding them to the geometry as it is being sketched. 
Analyse contains commands which allow the user to do this and to configure which types of constraint are searched for. 
As geometry is being input, constraints of the specified types will be searched for each time the cursor is moved.

Analyse will check if constraints are satisfied to within a particular tolerance. 
The tolerance can be changed with the command Graphics functions... Pick radius. 
Any constraint found could be satisfied exactly by moving the cursor by a value less than the current pick radius.

Analyse has two modes for deducing constraints depending upon if the toggle Utilities... Sketching options…Autoconstrain sketching is on or off. 
When it is off (which is the default) the following constraints will be found:

- When a point is being created with Make point it will be made coincident with an existing point within the pick radius of the cursor.
- Other commands which make points (e.g. 
Make line, Make circle), will not create a new point if an existing point is within the pick radius of the cursor. 
They will instead re-use the existing point.
- When a point is being created with any other command, if another geometry that is not a point is within the pick radius of the cursor, a coincident constraint will be placed between the point and the other geometry.
- When a point is being created, if the cursor is within pick radius of two intersecting curves, the point will be made coincident with both curves.

If the toggle Utilities... Sketching options… Autoconstrain sketching is on, the other commands on the Autoconstrain options... menu will control which constraints are searched for.
