## 13.2 Autodimensioning

Autodimensioning is the process where dimensions are added to an under-constrained model. 
Autodimensioning is similar to autoconstraining, except that it is used to apply dimensions with a value and not logical constraints. 
Autodimensioning will take account of existing constraints and dimensions and will never result in an over-dimensioned model.

This section describes the functions that are available in the DCM to support autodimensioning and how these can be used in an application. 
Note that it is recommended that constraints should be added to a model before adding dimensions.

In general, there are many ways in which a consistent set of dimensions can be applied to a model. 
Typically, in a model with N under-constrained geometries, N dimensions are needed and there are of order N2 ways in which they can be applied.

The application can reduce the total number of possible dimensions by informing the DCM which classes of dimension to try. 
This is done by using combinations of options, for example:

- Which type(s) of geometry to dimension between.
- Which type(s) of dimension to use.
- An array of specific geometries to dimension. 
Dimensions will only be tried if they are between geometries in this array.
- Specific pairs of geometries to dimension between.

Some dimensions will be rejected because there is no degree of freedom available to apply the dimension.

Even when this has been done it will still be possible to apply the dimensions in many different combinations. 
To give repeatable results, the DCM will sort the dimensions into an order. 
Then each dimension will be tried in turn to see if it can be applied to the model without making it over-defined. 
If it can, the application will be given the choice of whether this should be added to the model. 
If not, it will be discarded.

The order that the dimensions are sorted is determined by a weight. 
The DCM will ask the application for the weight to use for each dimension. 
If the application chooses not to give distinct weights, the DCM will use built-in defaults. 
If an application returns a weight of less than zero this will be ignored by the DCM and the built-in defaults will be used instead.

Note that when identifying dimensions, DCM will not offer all permutations of constraints. 
For example, if a distance from geometry A to geometry B is offered, then it will not also offer the distance from B to A. 
However, for angles, the DCM\_OPVAL\_AUTODIM\_ANGLES\_ONE / DCM\_OPVAL\_AUTODIM\_ANGLES\_BOTH values for the DCM\_OPKEY\_AUTODIM\_ANGLES option can be used to change this and force DCM to offer both dimensions.

In general, Autodimension will only attempt to add dimensions which remove a single degree of freedom. 
For example, it will not consider the addition of a distance dimension between two geometrically parallel lines if the angle between them is also a freedom. 
Only lines that are constrained to remain parallel will be considered candidates for the distance dimension. 
In part because of this limitation, it is always recommended that models are initially constrained using DCM’s autoconstrain function which can apply parallel constraints automatically before using the autodimension function.

There are currently two interface functions available for autodimensioning. 
The newest autodimension function, described in more detail in section [16.11.2 autodimension – Automatically generate dimensions](16.11._Autodimensioning_and_autoconstraining.md)

### 13.2.1 Automatic dimensioning in the Analyse user interface

The DCM includes powerful and flexible facilities to automatically apply dimension to under-defined geometry. 
These are made available in the Analyse user interface on two menus, Dimensioning... Autodimension... and Low level autodimension....

The autodimensioning commands will result in dimensions being added to the display. 
In Analyse, a very simple algorithm is used to decide how to place the dimensions on the display, and as a result it will sometimes be found that the dimensions overlap each other. 
It is the responsibility of an application to decide how to position its dimensions.

#### 13.2.1.1 Autodim/autocon menu

The toggle Block singular in the Analyse menu Autodim/autocon… enables the singular configuration diagnostic in the new (introduced in version 68.0) autodimension interface function. 
When this toggle is ON, dimensions that would increase the degree of singularity of the model will be rejected. 
This can determine a significant performance degradation. 
When this toggle is OFF, Analyse will use the old autodimension algorithm, and therefore singular dimensioning scheme could potentially arise.

#### 13.2.1.2 General autodimensioning

The Low level autodim... commands work in a way that is very similar to the DCM interface functions. 
These commands can be used during the development of an application in order to investigate various implementations of autodimensioning.

On this menu, the user can select the type or types of dimensions to use, types of geometry to dimension, and an option to control the mode of dimensioning. 
This information is then given to the DCM using the command Add selection which calls the function add\_autodimension\_mask. 
Several calls to this function can be made with different selections in order to add to the autodimensioning options.

Once all the required options have been added, the Autodimension command can be used to call the DCM function autodimension. 
This will search for and apply dimensions as specified by the calls to add\_autodimension\_mask.

The final dimensioning scheme depends only on the order that the DCM will try to add dimensions to the geometry. 
As each dimension is tried the DCM will determine if it will make the model become over-defined, and will either add it to the model or discard it before trying the next dimension. 
An application can control the order (and thereby the final dimensioning scheme) by making repeated calls to autodimension with different options. 
However it is still likely that there will be several dimensions that can be added by a single call, and then the DCM will ask the application to specify a weight for each possible dimension.

Analyse is able to determine and return to the DCM a weight for each dimension. 
This will be used to control the sequence of trying dimensions. 
Alternatively the Equal weight command can be set ON. 
Analyse will then always return the same weight for each dimension and force the DCM to decide upon the order to try each dimension.

The weights used by Analyse are found by considering several aspects of each dimension. 
These are listed below and the order in which they are given is relevant. 
For example, the type of dimension is more important when setting the weight than the value of the dimension.

- Type of dimension, in the following order:

- Radius dimensions on circles (highest weight)
- Major radius dimensions on ellipses
- Minor radius dimensions on ellipses
- Angle dimensions
- Distance dimensions between parallel lines
- Distance dimensions between lines and points
- Distance dimensions between other types of geometry (lowest weight)

- Fixed geometry. 
Dimensions between a fixed and an unfixed geometry have a higher weight than dimensions between two unfixed geometries.
- Value of dimension. 
Dimensions with small values have a higher weight than dimensions with large values.

In cases where Analyse returns the same weights for two or more dimensions, the DCM will use internally chosen weights to sort the dimensions, and determine the order in which they should be applied. 
This will always be necessary when the Equal weight command is ON. 
The weights used by the DCM are selected by sorting in the following ways, again with the first being the one with the highest weight.

- Sort according to the type of dimension in the order radius, major radius, minor radius, angle, distance.
- Sort according to the type of geometry being dimensioned, with lines being preferred to other geometries.
- Sort according to if the geometries are fixed, with fixed geometry being preferred to unfixed.
- Sort according to the position of the geometries. 
This final stage is used to give repeatable results on otherwise identical dimensions.

#### 13.2.1.3 Intelligent autodimensioning

The commands on the Low level autodim... menu are intentionally low-level to illustrate more clearly the use of the DCM interface. 
They do not give an accurate impression of the possibilities of developing a sophisticated autodimensioning capability in an application. 
The commands on the Autodimension... menu illustrate a possible implementation of a sophisticated autodimensioning capability. 
These commands do not provide access to all of the capabilities of the DCM interface. 
Instead, there are a smaller number of commands that will apply dimensions to typical models in a highly automated manner.

The individual commands are described in the Analyse User Guide. 
Most of them operate in a straightforward manner. 
Some of the more sophisticated commands are described below.

##### 13.2.1.3.1 Ladder mode

The Ladder mode command makes it possible to modify the weights that Analyse will return when applying distance dimensions between lines. 
Normally weights are found according to the rules listed above. 
With Ladder mode ON the weights returned for line-line distances will be modified. 
Instead of preferentially dimensioning to fixed lines Analyse will allocate weights depending upon whether the bounded lines "overlap" when one is projected onto the other. 
This is illustrated in [Figure 67: Allocation of weights in ladder mode](#_Ref420987760). No other weights are affected.

##### 13.2.1.3.2 Profile sequence

The Profile sequence command is intended to be a quick way of applying dimensions to a selected set of geometry that represents a connected sequence of lines and arcs. 
The command will do the following to the selected geometry in the order given:

- Radii will be applied to all arcs where possible (i.e. 
where there is an appropriate degree of freedom).
- Angle dimensions will be applied where possible between lines that meet at a common vertex, or have a blend between them.
- Distance dimensions will be applied where possible between lines that are constrained parallel.

This is exactly equivalent to selecting the same geometries and then using the Autodim radii, Autodim l-l angles and Autodim l-l distances commands.

Note that this command does not try all possible dimensions, so it is quite possible that the selected geometry is still under-constrained. 
If desired, the command Autodim completely can be used to add further dimensions to the selected geometry.

##### 13.2.1.3.3 Model sequence

The Model sequence command is intended as an example of how dimensions can be applied to a model in a highly automated way. 
The sequence of operations has been found to give a satisfactory dimensioning scheme on a wide range of models. 
However an application will need to experiment with typical model data.

The command can be broken down into a number of steps. 
For each step geometry is selected, and then it is autodimensioned with particular options. 
Note that autodimensioning will look at all possible dimensions, but will only add them when there is an available degree of freedom. 
At each step the actual dimensions that are added are dependent upon the weights returned by Analyse.

The sequence of operations is as follows:

- Radius dimensions are added.
- Individual profiles are selected by propagating along bounded curves, starting at an under-constrained geometry. 
The Profile sequence commands are then used on the resulting profile. 
This is continued until all under-constrained geometries have been visited. 
Note that this is the only command that uses the profiles.
- Distance dimensions are added between pairs of lines constrained parallel.
- Angle dimensions are added between lines with a common geometry, as with the command Autodim l-l angles.
- Angle dimensions are added between lines, even if they do not have a common geometry.
- Points that lie on unbounded lines are selected. 
Distance dimensions are added between these points.
- Distance dimensions are added from fixed lines to points, except points that are at a tangency. 
For example, a point which is coincident with a line and a circle that have been made tangent will not be selected.
- Distance dimensions are added from fixed lines to all points, including points at a tangency.
- All other dimensions are added.

The Model sequence command will call the constraint\_balance function, and terminate when this function indicates that there are no freedoms remaining.
