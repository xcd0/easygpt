# 9\. Evaluated parametric curves

The DCM can manipulate directly points, lines, circles, ellipses and splines. 
In addition to these geometry types, many applications also work with various types of parametric curves. 
These may include splines, cubic segments and other curve types. 
The DCM contains facilities for representing and working with all of these types.

An application may also need to work with a single curve made up by fitting together a number of lines and arcs. 
These are referred to as compound curves and they can also be represented as parametric curves in the DCM.

The DCM supports several different types of parametric curves. 
This chapter contains details about which types of curve are supported and what an application needs to do to use them.

Note: It is possible for an application to use the DCM parametric curve type to represent spline curves. 
However, it is recommended that the DCM spline curves are used whenever possible.
