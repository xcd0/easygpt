## 9.3 Parametric curves with discontinuities

Evaluated parametric curves in the DCM must conform to these limitations:

- The curve must be C0 continuous – i.e. 
geometrically continuous.
- Each parameter on the curve must correspond to a unique geometrical location, with the exception that self-intersecting curves are supported. 
Curves parameter values where the first derivative is zero (e.g. 
the parameter range 2-4 corresponds to a single point on the curve) are not supported. 
(Note however that the parameter value need not be continuous – see below for details.)

The DCM supports evaluated parametric curves that have discontinuities in their parameter value or derivatives, however, as long as the application can identify the location of these discontinuities. 
The curve may have:

- Non-continuous parameter value (i.e. 
discontinuities in the value of the parameter)
- G1 discontinuities (i.e. 
discontinuities in the first derivative direction or magnitude)
- C1 discontinuities (i.e. 
discontinuities in the magnitude of the first derivative).

The DCM requires information on the location of these discontinuities and data on the curve either side of them. 
The DCM obtains this by calling the Frustum function DCM\_parametric\_n\_discons to find the number of curve discontinuities and DCM\_parametric\_discon\_data to get the curve data on either side of each discontinuity.

### 9.3.1 Discontinuity locations

For non-periodic curves, only internal discontinuities are required by the DCM. 
Parameter limits should not be counted as a discontinuity. 
The discontinuities are identified by D#1, D#2, D#3, etc. 
and are arranged in increasing parameter value as shown in [Figure 58: Locations of discontinuities](#_Ref424464202).

Figure 58: Locations of discontinuities

For periodic curves the DCM requires that the discontinuity parameters all lie within the range of a single period. 
For example, for a curve with period 5, the DCM could be informed that the discontinuities have parameter values of 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0, or 11.0, 12.0, 13.0, 14.0. If there is a discontinuity at the seam, then this must be included in the list.

### 9.3.2 Parameter value discontinuities

This section describes how parameter value discontinuities can be used.

An example of a curve which can be represented is shown in [Figure 59: Example of a parameter value discontinuity](#_Ref359943276) below. 
In the left figurea, a parametric curve has a loop which is formed when it intersects itself at parameter values of 1 and 2. An application might want to trim away the loop caused by this self-intersection, to leave the curve shown in bold in the figure on the right.

Figure 59: Example of a parameter value discontinuity

The curve on the rightis represented to the DCM as a bounded parametric curve, with parameter limits of 0 to 3. It has a single discontinuity in the parameter value and first derivative at parameter values of 1 (on the lower side) and 2 (on the upper side).

When necessary, the DCM will enquire the number of discontinuities on the curve. 
It will also enquire the parameter value, position and derivatives on the lower and upper side of each discontinuity. 
To implement parameter range discontinuities, an application may simply return different parameter values for the upper and lower sides. 
In the example above, the parameter value of 1 would be returned for the lower side and 2 for the upper side.

Note that the DCM will never call an evaluator function within the limits of a parameter value discontinuity (i.e., between 1 and 2 in the above example).
