## 9.1 Overview of evaluated parametric curves

Evaluated parametric curves are added as geometries with type DCM\_PARAMETRIC. 
The DCM makes the following assumptions about evaluated parametric curves:

- The application defines the shape of the curve by using a single parameter value.
- For a given parameter value, the application is able to return a position on the curve, the first derivative of the curve and an approximation to the second derivative. 
The DCM finds this information by calling the Frustum function DCM\_parametric\_evaluator.
- Evaluated parametric curves may be limited and only defined for a range of parameter values. 
Alternatively they may be closed and periodic. 
In principle the parameter on a periodic curve "wraps around" and can have any value. 
The DCM finds information about whether a curve is limited, periodic, and its parameter values by using the Frustum functions DCM\_parametric\_limits and DCM\_parametric\_period.
- The curves must not have any "gaps" and must be position continuous. 
They do not need to be G1 (tangent) continuous or C1 (first derivative) continuous. 
The DCM expects to be informed of the position of any discontinuities in the direction or magnitude of the first derivative. 
See section [9.3 Parametric curves with discontinuities](9.3._Parametric_curves_with_discontinuities.md)
- The curve parameter is allowed to have "jumps" in its value. 
These parameter value discontinuities allow an application more freedom in choosing a curve parameterisation. 
Further details are in section [9.3 Parametric curves with discontinuities](9.3._Parametric_curves_with_discontinuities.md)
- Evaluated parametric curves have a direction. 
This direction of a parametric is assigned by the application and can be defined in any way that the application chooses. 
In [Figure 56: Parallel parametrics](#_Ref420907450) the application has chosen to use a direction from the start to the end of the cubic segments. 
These lines have been drawn in the diagram, but the parallel constraint is applied to the parametric curve itself.
- Evaluated parametric curves cannot have a zero first derivative anywhere.



The direction of a parametric curve can be controlled by adding dimensions such as parallel or angle. 
This allows the application to control directly the rotational freedom of the parametric curve.

It is important that the application defines curves which satisfy the conditions above in the region of any dimensions of constraints and it is strongly recommended that these conditions are satisfied for the entire curve.

### 9.1.1 Discontinuity definitions

[Figure 57: Definition of discontinuity terms](#_Ref456080983) shows an example of a section of a curve (ag) containing a discontinuity. 
In this example, there is a discontinuity in the value of the parameter value from t1 at the lower side of the discontinuity to t2 at the upper side. 
When necessary, the DCM will request the values of t (the parameter), pt (the position on the curve), p1 (the first derivative) and p2 (the second derivative) on the "lower" and "upper" side of the discontinuity. 
The magnitudes and directions of both derivatives are different on the lower and upper side of the discontinuity.
