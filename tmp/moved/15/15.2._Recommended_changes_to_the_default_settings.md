## 15.2 Recommended changes to the default settings

The DCM provides a number of options that can be changed to control the overall behaviour. 
Each of these options has a default value which is used if the application does not set them. 
In some cases, the default option provides less powerful functionality than the other options available.

The defaults are selected to ensure the maximum backwards compatibility with older versions of the DCM, which is very important for history based applications that need to load and re-solve models created with earlier versions of the DCM. 
Note that if an option is considered sufficiently important, then the default will be added such that it causes DCM behaviour to change. 
In those cases, the switches allow applications to ensure backwards compatibility by adding the switch to their existing applications.

For new integrations, or for applications that are dealing only with new data, it is recommended that the following options are turned ON in order to give the best experience of using the 2D DCM:

- DCM\_OPKEY\_USE\_WORST\_PARTIAL\_STATUS
- DCM\_OPKEY\_CHAIN\_SOLVING

The effects of these options are described in section [16.2 Configure global DCM behaviour](16.2._Configure_global_DCM_behaviour.md)
