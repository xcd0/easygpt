## 15.9 Extended geometry types

In addition to the different types of geometries that are supported directly by the DCM. 
It is also possible for an application to provide other geometry types by combinations of these. 
This section shows an example of this implemented in our demonstration program.

The Analyse user interface uses a particular representation for an arc. 
This representation does not behave in the expected manner in some circumstances. 
One particular case occurs when a blend is constructed between two lines, and the angle between the lines is changed. 
This is shown in [Figure 75: Behaviour of a standard arc](#_Ref420988067):

The DCM is preserving the chirality of the circle, but this does not keep the intent of the blend the same.

The Analyse test harness has the facility to turn a conventional blend into an adaptive blend. 
An adaptive blend will behave as shown below when the angle between the lines is changed:

Figure 76: Behaviour of an adaptive blend

This effect is achieved by constructing a second circle. 
This is positioned on the other side of both lines and is also constrained to be tangent to the lines. 
Two new points, constrained coincident to the new circle and the lines, are also created. 
Only one arc will be visible at any time, and the drawing routines will choose which arc to draw based upon the angle between the lines.
