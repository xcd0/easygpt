# 15\. Integrating the DCM into an Application

The DCM is designed as a software module. 
The interfaces described in chapter [16\. The DCM Interface](16._The_DCM_Interface.md)

The Analyse user interface uses all of the functionality of the DCM. 
Analyse is delivered with the DCM, and can be used to give some ideas for implementing a DCM based system. 
The way that the DCM is integrated into Analyse is referred to below where appropriate. 
Analyse also includes some functionality that builds upon what is provided by the DCM. 
This is also described below.

Any implementers of a system based on the DCM will need to consider how best to make use of the facilities available. 
Although every application is different, there are some issues that will need to be considered for almost every DCM application. 
These are described in the sections below.
