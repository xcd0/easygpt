## 15.10 Constraining the length of a curve

This section describes how the length of a curve may be constrained using the DCM. 
In each case the curve is defined by an underlying curve (which may be a line, circle, ellipse or parametric) and two points. 
The curve length may have a numeric value or may be variable.

- Line

The line length can be a simple dimension between the two bounding points.
- Circular arc

The length of a circular arc can be constrained with an arc length dimension. 
See [4.1.5 Arc length](4.1._Dimensions_with_a_value.md)



Note that it is also possible to use non-linear equations to constrain an arc length: Construct two lines constrained coincident to the circle centre and coincident to the points bounding the arc. 
Add a variable angle dimension between these lines and add a variable radius dimension to the circle. 
The arc length will be the product of the angle and the radius and this can be represented by a non-linear equation in the DCM (Note that the angle dimension will have to be adjusted so that it lies in the correct sector.)
- Ellipses, parametric curves and arcs

The length of an ellipse or parametric curve may be constrained using a curve length dimension. 
To dimension a part of the curve (e.g., an elliptical arc) the p\_nodes of the curve length dimension can have equal parameter constraints to the p\_nodes of the end points of the arc. 
See section [4.1.6 Curve length](4.1._Dimensions_with_a_value.md)
