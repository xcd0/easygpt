## 15.1 Software structure

The DCM is written specifically as a software component for other systems. 
It is coded in C++. It is designed to be used with C++, C or any other high level language which supports an ANSI C calling structure.

The main functions of the DCM are accessed through the DCM interface. 
However, an important feature of the DCM is that it holds only the connectivity of the dimensioning scheme and references to the geometric data and the dimensioning data held by the application. 
This separation means that the application can be independent of the DCM. 
For example, the geometric and dimensioning data can be stored without any reference to the DCM. 
The DCM structure is just built up again when needed.

The geometric and dimension data is accessed by the DCM via the Frustum interface. 
The functions in the Frustum interface must be supplied by the application to provide information about geometric and dimension entities and to alter the geometry. 
However, dummy Frustum functions can be used when the DCM is passing information to the application that the application does not require, or when the DCM will not call the functions. 
For example, several Frustum functions will only be called, and hence need only be implemented, if the application is using parametric geometry.

The application and the DCM exchange data by means of C or C++ pointers to the application data and to the DCM data. 
The DCM makes use of application data and thus the application must not delete any data that has been declared to the DCM until the references to it are deleted. 
In order to make use of the DCM the application needs to maintain references to the DCM data. 
However, the application cannot read data from the DCM and will therefore also need to keep a record of the connectivity between dimensions and geometry.
