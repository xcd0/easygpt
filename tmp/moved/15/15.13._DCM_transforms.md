## 15.13 DCM transforms

The DCM uses transformation matrices to represent translations and rotations of geometry. 
It will only output transforms containing translation and rotational components. 
Transformation matrices representing translations and rotations are also passed to the function dynamic\_evaluate by the application. 
The DCM does not expect to receive transforms of any other kind, e.g. 
scaling. 
If unexpected transforms are used they may not have the desired effect.

DCM transforms consist of two parts:

- A translation vector, dx in the x direction, dy in the y direction:

- A rotation matrix of angle q:

![rotation_matrix.bmp](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/DCM transforms_1.png)

These are combined together in a single transformation matrix:

![transformation_matrix.bmp](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/DCM transforms_2.png)

The transformation matrix should be applied directly to any position vector by pre-multiplying, e.g. 
for point positions,

The rotation part alone should be applied to direction vectors by pre-multiplying, e.g. 
line directions,

The rotation matrix is defined for a rotation about the origin (0,0) with a positive value in the clockwise direction; it is not necessary to know the value of q. 
Note that this is different from the definition of angle dimensions within the DCM which are positive in the anti-clockwise direction.

In terms of "C" or "C++", the matrix elements are as follows:

double transform\[3\]\[3\];

transform\[0\]\[0\] = cosq;transform\[0\]\[1\] = sinq;transform\[0\]\[2\] = dx;

transform\[1\]\[0\] = - sinq;transform\[1\]\[1\] = cosq;transform\[1\]\[2\] = dy;

transform\[2\]\[0\] = 0.0;transform\[2\]\[1\] = 0.0;transform\[2\]\[2\] = 1.0;

The DCM functions dynamic\_evaluate and move\_and\_evaluate require an array of transformation matrices. 
This can be difficult to declare correctly. 
The following code gives a method of creating this data structure in an application written in C or C++.

gnode\*\* gnode\_array;

int i, j, k, N\_transforms;

DCM\_dragging\_result drag\_result;

double (\*\*transform\_array)\[3\];

N\_transforms = 2;

gnode\_array = (gnode\*\*)malloc(sizeof(gnode\*) \* N\_transforms);

gnode\_array\[0\] = "a g\_node\*";

gnode\_array\[1\] = "another g\_node";

transform\_array = (double(\*\*)\[3\])malloc(sizeof(double(\*)\[3\]) \* N\_transforms);

/\\* now create the individual transforms \*/

for (i=0; i<N\_transforms; i++)

{

transform\_array\[i\] = (double(\*)\[3\])malloc(sizeof(double) \* 9);

/\\* initialise to identity \*/

for (j=0; j<3; j++)

for (k=0; k<3; k++)

transform\_array\[i\]\[j\]\[k\] = j==k;

/\\* make the transform a translation \*/

transform\_array\[i\]\[0\]\[2\] = "some x value";

transform\_array\[i\]\[1\]\[2\] = "some y value";

}

/\\* call C function \*/

DCM\_dynamic\_evaluateg(ds, N\_transforms, gnode\_array,

transform\_array, DCM\_NULL, &drag\_type, &drag\_result,

DCM\_DRAG\_POSSIBLE, DCM\_MINIMUM\_MOVE\_SOLVE);

The array of transformation matrices may have a DCM\_NULL value at the appropriate place. 
To implement this, the code example given above would be modified to include:

transform\_array\[i\] = DCM\_NULL;
