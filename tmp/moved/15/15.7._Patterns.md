## 15.7 Patterns

Section [4.3.11 Pattern constraints](4.3._Logical_constraints.md)
This section describes the best way to add constraints onto groups of patterned geometries and describes the use of pattern constraints to make regular polygons.

Figure 73: Linear Pattern

[Figure 73: Linear Pattern](#_Ref469735179) shows a linear pattern. 
To model this, the application must add all the geometries with the right initial chiralities to the DCM using the add\_g function. 
It must create a linear pattern using the function add\_pattern. 
The application should also:

- Duplicate all the constraints (note not dimensions) within the groups of geometries, e.g. 
P0 is coincident to L0, hence P1 is also made coincident with L1, P2 is constrained coincident to P2, etc.
- Pattern constraints should be added between all the patterned geometries, i.e. 
P0, P1 and P2 are patterned, L0, L1 and L2 are also patterned.

Although not all these constraints are required to define the model, they will help the DCM solve patterned geometries optimally.
