## 15.8 Regular polygons

The use of circular patterns is the recommended method of making regular polygons with the DCM. 
[Figure 74: Regular polygon created using a closed circular pattern](#_Ref469800263) shows an octagon created by using a closed circular pattern in the DCM. 
To construct this all the lines and points for the polygon and the pattern node (a point or a circle) are added using the add\_g function and coincident constraints are added between the appropriate points and lines.

Figure 74: Regular polygon created using a closed circular pattern

The pattern node is created using the add\_pattern function.

There are two schemes that can be used to create the pattern: The reference/instance and chain methods. 
The reference/instance method will typically give better performance and more reliable measurement of the satisfied function. 
It will also ensure the pattern remains closed so long as the first and last elements are present, even if an intermediate edge or point geometry is erased. 
The chain method will have the property of becoming an open pattern when a single member is erased, but will not have any position with a particularly special property (i.e. 
there is no one element you can erase that will remove all pattern constraints immediately).

In the reference/instance approach, all pattern constraints are placed between a reference element and each instance element, with increasing mulitiplers (i.e. 
multipler 1 for P0 and P1, multipler 2 for P1 and P2, etc.). The pattern is closed by adding an additional negative multiplier between the last instance element and the reference. 
In this example, as well as a pattern constraint multiplier 7 between P0 and P7, there would be a pattern multipler constraint of -1 between the same P0 and P7.

In the chain approach, all the points are patterned to create a closed circular pattern. 
For example a pattern constraint is added between P0 and P1, P1 and P2, P2 and P3, etc., and finally between P7 and P0. Using this scheme all the pattern multipliers will have a magnitude of 1. Other patterning schemes are described in section [4.3.11 Pattern constraints](4.3._Logical_constraints.md)

The lines can also be patterned similarly. 
Adding all the coincidence and the pattern constraints does over-define the model but the DCM will solve this, as the constraints will be consistent.

The advantages of using pattern constraints over other possible dimensioning schemes (e.g. 
symmetry, equal distance, angle dimensions) to create regular polygons are:

- The DCM solves them more reliably.
- All the polygon vertices will have the right chirality.
- The DCM can handle over constrained but consistent cases, e.g. 
it will recognise that opposite sides of even-sided polygons are parallel.
