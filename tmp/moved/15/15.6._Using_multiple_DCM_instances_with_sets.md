## 15.6 Using multiple DCM instances with sets

The Analyse user interface demonstrates one possible way of working with sets. 
When sets are defined multiple instances of the DCM will be used. 
It is possible to evaluate the model in two ways:

- A single set is selected. 
Evaluating will only change the geometry in the selected set.
- All sets are selected. 
Dimensions and constraints that are between geometries in the same set will be ignored and the dimensions will be drawn in grey. 
Evaluating will move each set and its geometry rigidly.

These effects are achieved by creating a separate instance of the DCM for each set. 
Each instance of the DCM includes only the geometry that is in the corresponding set, but does not include the set itself. 
When a set is selected, just this DCM will be evaluated.

In addition to the instance of the DCM for the geometries inside each set, there is also one further DCM that is used to evaluate the sets. 
This instance will contain the sets, the geometries in these sets (applications may choose to only add the geometries constrained to other geometries not in the set) and any geometries that are not in a set. 
If no sets are defined, this is the only instance of the DCM that is created.

An application need not use the same structure as described here. 
The methods that are used in the Analyse user interface are only intended to illustrate one possible technique.
