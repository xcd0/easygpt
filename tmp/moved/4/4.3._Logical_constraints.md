## 4.3 Logical constraints

Logical constraints (normally just referred to as constraints) do not have associated values. 
Often they are only represented implicitly on engineering drawings (whereas dimensions with values normally need to be shown explicitly). In some circumstances logical constraints and dimensions are treated differently. 
The possible types of logical constraint are given below.

In one special case a dimension with a value can imply the existence of a logical constraint. 
This is a distance dimension between a pair of lines, which implies a logical constraint of parallel between them. 
Generally, the DCM will not interpret special values of distance dimensions as logical constraints. 
For example, two lines with an angle of zero between them will not be interpreted as parallel. 
However, DCM will imply a logical constraint for a rigid dimension, e.g. 
it will imply a perpendicular if a rigid angle value is multiple of 90Ëš (see section [4.2 Rigid dimensions](4.2._Rigid_dimensions.md)

DCM function: [add\_d](16.3._Defining_the_model_data.md)

Frustum function: [DCM\_dimension\_type](17.2._Basic_dimension_functions.md)

### 4.3.1 Parallel

This is defined only between pairs of geometries with a direction, i.e., lines, ellipses and parametrics. 
It implies that the directions of the geometries are parallel. 
Specifying two geometries as parallel is not the same as putting on a zero angular dimension. 
For instance, when two lines are made parallel the forward direction of the lines makes no difference. 
Thus, following an evaluation, lines could be parallel and aligned or "anti-parallel".

![fig22_aligned.bmp](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Logical constraints.png)

Figure 22: Either of these configurations is possible with parallel lines

With two parallel ellipses the following configuration is one of the two possibilities. 
Note that the line drawn on the ellipse identifies the direction of the major axis.

![fig23_parallel_ellipse.bmp](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Logical constraints_1.png)

Figure 23: Parallel ellipses

The default solution returned that is nearest to the original configuration of the geometries but can be controlled using the Frustum function [DCM\_dimension\_alignment](17.2._Basic_dimension_functions.md)

### 4.3.2 Perpendicular

This is defined only between pairs of geometries with a direction and implies that the directions are perpendicular. 
As with parallel dimensions there are two possible solutions and the DCM will choose the one that is nearest to the original configuration of the geometries but can be controlled using the Frustum function [DCM\_dimension\_alignment](17.2._Basic_dimension_functions.md)

### 4.3.3 Concentric

This is defined for any combination of circles, ellipses and points. 
It can also be defined between a conic and a point. 
It implies that the centres of the geometries coincide. 
For an ellipse, the centre is taken to be at the intersection of the major and the minor axes, and for a conic the centre is taken to be the focus. 
Some examples are:

- Circle/circle \- The circles are concentric.
- Circle/point \- The point lies at the centre of the circle.
- Point/point \- The points are identical. 
This will give identical result to using a coincident constraint.

An example of two concentric ellipses is given in [Figure 24: Concentric ellipses](#_Ref420911624).

![fig24_concentric_ellipses.bmp](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Logical constraints_2.png)

Figure 24: Concentric ellipses

For a concentric constraint between a conic and a point, the conic must have shape DCM\_CONIC\_SHAPE\_PARABOLA and type DCM\_CONIC\_TYPE\_FIXED\_SHAPE\_BEZIER. 
Conics of other shapes and types are not currently supported.

### 4.3.4 Tangent

This is defined between a curved geometry - a circle, ellipse or parametric, and either another curved geometry or a line, and implies that the geometries are tangential. 
Note that a help point can optionally be specified for a tangent constraint to a circle or an ellipse. 
A help parameter must be specified for a tangent constraint to a parametric. 
Section [4.1.2.3 Help points and help parameters](4.1._Dimensions_with_a_value.md)

#### 4.3.4.1 Tangent alignment

The alignment of a tangent constraint can be controlled by the application. 
This determines whether the tangent directions of the two curves are the same or in opposite directions. 
If the angle between the directions is 0 degrees the tangency is aligned. 
If it is 180 degrees, then the tangency is anti-aligned.

![fig25_aligned_anti_tangents.bmp](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Logical constraints_3.png)

Figure 25: Aligned and Anti-aligned tangent constraints

In earlier versions of the DCM, the application was only able to specify and to change the alignment of tangent constraints by pre-positioning of geometry. 
This release adds the ability to specify the alignment of a tangent constraint when it is created or edited, removing the need for pre-positioning of the constraint. 
Furthermore, when applying tangents to parametric geometry, if the alignment was not specified, the DCM could change the alignment in order to reach a solution. 
Using alignments will force the alignment to be preserved at all times.

Frustum function: [DCM\_tangent\_alignment](17.2._Basic_dimension_functions.md)

### 4.3.5 Coincident

If a coincident constraint is defined between a point and any geometry then this implies that the point lies on the geometry. 
Note that a help point can optionally be specified for a coincident constraint between a point and a circle or an ellipse. 
A help parameter must be specified for a coincident constraint between a point and a parametric. 
Section [4.1.2.3 Help points and help parameters](4.1._Dimensions_with_a_value.md)

A coincident constraint defined between two geometries of the same type implies that they are identical. 
For example, a coincident constraint between two circles or two ellipses implies that their centres coincide and they have the same radii.

Between two lines or two ellipses, a coincident constraint also implies that they are parallel or anti-parallel. 
DCM will choose the solution nearest to the original configuration of the geometries but can be controlled using the Frustum function [DCM\_dimension\_alignment](17.2._Basic_dimension_functions.md)

### 4.3.6 Symmetric

A symmetric constraint is defined between two geometries of the same type and a line. 
It implies that the two geometries are symmetrically arranged on opposite sides of the line. 
If two circles or ellipses are made symmetric, their radii will be the same. 
Symmetry constraints can be applied between spline curves. 
See section [9.4.2 Constraints between dependent parametric curves](9.4._Dependent_evaluated_parametric_curves.md)

See section [2.7.2 Over-constrained but consistent models](2.7._Solving_over-defined_models.md)

Pre-resolving can improve the performance when solving symmetries. 
The level at which the DCM pre-resolves the model can be set via set\_option. 
See section [16.2.6.9 Pre-resolve level](16.2._Configure_global_DCM_behaviour.md)

#### 4.3.6.1 Symmetry alignment

The application can control the alignment of a symmetry constraint when it is applied between directed geometries (lines, ellipses, splines and evaluated parametrics).

A symmetry is aligned when reflecting one geometry about the axis, it becomes coincident aligned to the other geometry. 
A symmetry is anti-aligned when reflecting one geometry about the axis it becomes coincident anti-aligned to the other geometry.

[Figure 26 Aligned (left) and anti-aligned (right) symmetry constraints](#_Ref114564722) illustrates the two configurations. 
Note that the direction of the symmetry axis is not relevant to the symmetry alignment. 
In these examples it could be up or down in either case.

![](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Logical constraints_4.png)

Figure 26 Aligned (left) and anti-aligned (right) symmetry constraints

In earlier versions of the DCM, symmetry alignment could only be influenced by the application via pre-positioning the geometries. 
The DCM could still modify the alignment with respect to the initial positions of the geometries though. 
Starting with version 75, the application can enforce the desired alignment via a dedicated Frustum function, DCM\_symmetry\_alignment, when creating or editing the symmetry constraint, without the need for pre-positioning. 
If the application chooses not to specify the alignment, DCM is likely to solve to the configuration which is closest to the original geometry positions, although this is not guaranteed.

Frustum function: [DCM\_symmetry\_alignment](17.2._Basic_dimension_functions.md)

### 4.3.7 Normal

A normal constraint can be applied between a line or curve and a curve (two lines cannot be made normal, a perpendicular constraint must be used instead). This implies that the curves intersect and at the point of intersection the curve tangent directions are perpendicular. 
For example:

- A line can be made normal to an ellipse.
- A line can be made normal to a parametric curve.

Two ellipses can be made normal. 
There will be more than one place where the curves intersect and help points must be used to identify the appropriate intersection.

The DCM\_OPKEY\_NORMAL\_SOLVING\_MODE option allows the application to specify whether the normal constraint is solved using rotation or translation. 
See section [16.2.4.13 Solve normal constraints using rotation or translation](16.2._Configure_global_DCM_behaviour.md)
Note that DCM\_OPVAL\_NORMAL\_ROTATION was introduced in version 65, so applications may wish to select the DCM\_OPVAL\_NORMAL\_TRANSLATION value for legacy models to avoid behaviour changes.

By default the DCM will attempt to solve normal constraints using rotation. 
This usually provides a more intuitive solution, as a small rotation of the geometry can often replace a large translation. 
This is illustrated in [Figure 27: Solving normal constraints using rotation and translation](#_Ref428458776), in which we demonstrate a line tangent to a spline, next the solution if the geometry is rotated, and finally the solution if the geometry is translated.

![](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Logical constraints.jpg)![](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Logical constraints_1.jpg)![](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Logical constraints_2.jpg)

Figure 27: Solving normal constraints using rotation and translation

Even when using the option to default to translation when solving normal constraints, it is possible to influence DCM to rotate geometry to satisfy a normal constraint. 
An application can use additional controls, e.g.:

- A point can be added coincident with both geometries and the weighted standard solving mode used to keep that point stationary (see section [2.5.6.2 Weighted standard solving mode](2.5._Evaluating_the_model.md)
- With a parametric, a fixed help parameter can be specified at the desired intersection point (see section [7.3.1 Fixing help parameters](7.3._Help_parameters.md)

#### 4.3.7.1 Normal alignment

There are two alignment configurations that can satisfy a normal constraint, anti-clockwise and clockwise.

In the first configuration, the direction or tangent direction of the second geometry is obtained by rotating the direction or tangent direction of the first geometry anti-clockwise by 90o. 
In the second configuration, the rotation is clockwise. 
[Figure 28 Anti-clockwise (left) and clockwise (right) normal alignment between a spline and a line](#_Ref114582768) illustrates the two possible alignments of a normal constraint between a spline (first geometry) and a line (second geometry).

![](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Logical constraints_5.png)

Figure 28 Anti-clockwise (left) and clockwise (right) normal alignment between a spline and a line

In earlier versions of the DCM, normal alignment could only be influenced by the application via pre-positioning the geometries. 
DCM could still modify the alignment with respect to the initial positions of the geometries though. 
Starting with version 75 of the 2D DCM, the application can enforce which alignment the DCM will solve for with a dedicated Frustum function, DCM\_normal\_alignment.

The order of the geometries is the one used when adding the constraint, see [16.3.4 add\_r and add\_d - Creates a dimension node](16.3._Defining_the_model_data.md)

Frustum function: DCM\_normal\_alignment

### 4.3.8 Equal radius

An equal radius constraint can only be applied between two circles. 
It implies that their radii are the same as each other but does not control the actual value of the radii.

### 4.3.9 Midpoint constraints

A midpoint constraint can be applied between a point and either two other points or two lines. 
It implies that the point is equidistant from the other two geometries but does not control the actual distance. 
A typical use of a midpoint constraint would be to constrain a point to be at the middle of a bounded line by constraining it to the unbounded line and using a midpoint constraint to the ends of the line.

![fig26_midpoint.bmp](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Logical constraints_6.png)

Figure 29: Examples of midpoint constraints

In [Figure 29: Examples of midpoint constraints](#_Ref420912005), the point P1 is constrained with a midpoint constraint to P2 and P3. P4 has a midpoint constraint to L1 and L2.

See section [2.7.2 Over-constrained but consistent models](2.7._Solving_over-defined_models.md)

### 4.3.10 Equal distance constraints

An equal distance constraint is applied between two pairs of geometries. 
The constraint implies that the distance between the first pair of geometries should be the same as the distance between the second pair of geometries, but it does not control the actual value of the distance.

The equal distance constraint is supported between all pairs of geometry for which the distance dimension is supported. 
For circles, applications can optionally define a help point on any circle in the two pairs independently. 
For ellipses, either help points or help parameters are required. 
For parametric curves, applications must supply a help parameter for the curve, except in the case of an offset curve that is being constrained to either its parent curve, or to another offset curve sharing the same parent. 
For these offset curve cases, the equal distance is interpreted as the offset distance, or the difference in offset distances, respectively.

Note that where two of circles are constrained to be concentric, applications still have the option to specify help points. 
In this case, help points may be used to specify the sides of each circle the distance is measured between. 
This allows an application to specify the distance is between opposite sides of the circles instead of just the minimum distance.

To pick a certain solution when more than one exists, half spaces can be set on the two distance dimensions involved in the equal-distance constraint. 
A half-space defines on which side of a given directed geometry the distance is measured (right, left, or unspecified); See section [5.6 Dimension half space](5.6._Dimension_half_space.md)
A typical construction consists of driving the value of the (equal) distances using an additional simple distance dimension on one of the geometry pairs. 
In this case, the solution can be controlled by carefully defining the half spaces on that simple distance and on the two equal-distance pairs.

A typical use of the equal-distance constraint would be to make two lines have the same length by placing an equal distance constraint between their endpoints.

Note that if the two geometries in one of the equal-distance pairs are both lines, this will imply that the lines are parallel, as would be the case when using a regular distance dimension between those lines.

It is possible for an equal distance constraint to refer to a single geometry twice. 
For example, if two lines share an endpoint, it is still possible to make them have the same length.

See section [2.7.2 Over-constrained but consistent models](2.7._Solving_over-defined_models.md)

Frustum functions: [DCM\_equal\_distance\_dimension\_point](17.2._Basic_dimension_functions.md)

### 4.3.11 Pattern constraints

Models often contain "patterns" where a group of geometries of the same type is repeated in a regular way. 
2D DCM supports two sorts of pattern: One dimensional (1D) and two dimensional (2D). 1D patterns may be linear, where all the geometries in the pattern are offset by a constant linear distance, or angular where the geometries are offset by a constant angle about a centre point. 
2D patterns are always linear; the geometries in the 2D pattern are offset in two directions by two distinct offset distance values, to form a grid or array of geometry.

Constraints between the original group of geometries can be duplicated on the patterned geometry. 
The DCM automatically manages over-constrained but consistent cases. 
It is possible to place dimensions between geometries in the same group or between geometries in different groups. 
The value of the linear or angular offset may be given directly with a pattern value dimension, or it may be determined by other parts of the model. 
For instance, it will be possible to have a complete circular pattern where the DCM calculates the spacing, or a linear pattern that has a specified total length. 
The initial pattern values can also be specified, to suggest the pattern value before any evaluation takes place. 
This affects the underdefined solving behaviour, and allows the DCM to check if the model is already in a solved position.

For both 1D and 2D patterns, dimensions and constraints can be placed onto any of the geometries in the pattern. 
There is no requirement to place them all on one instance. 
[Figure 30: Dimensioned Linear pattern](#_Ref241554396) shows an example of pattern geometry constrained with dimensions on several instances. 
[Figure 33: Using a 2D pattern to change a grid of similar elements](#_Ref241554189) shows an example of using DCM to change both the patterned profile shape and the spacing of the pattern during a single solve. 
However, the DCM will solve pattern constraints more efficiently when the copies are all patterned from a single "master" copy and dimensions are added to the master copy. 
This allows the application to place all relevant constraints onto the model.

![fig27_linear_pattern.bmp](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Logical constraints_7.png)

Figure 30: Dimensioned Linear pattern

Pattern solving performance, and under-defined behaviour, is strongly affected by the pre-resolving option. 
Customers are encouraged to use the higher value available for this option, which is usually the default. 
Setting the value to earlier versions is only recommended for legacy models to access older under-defined behavours. 
See section [16.2.6.9 Pre-resolve level](16.2._Configure_global_DCM_behaviour.md)

Note that linear patterns can be represented either using the 1D or 2D pattern interface (by setting the second direction multiple to 0 for all elements). It is recommended for new customers that linear patterns are implemented usingi the 2D pattern interface. 
There are two benefits:

- Improved solving and performance, as a consequence of the restriction on the way patterns may be specified (all instances must be patterned to a common reference).

- Shared application code between the linear pattern implementation and any array pattern.

#### 4.3.11.1 1D patterns

Each 1D pattern requires the following:

- A reference node that represents the pattern. 
This node allows DCM to communicate the status of the pattern as a whole (e.g. 
is it well-defined) and allows the internal freedom to be constrained. 
A 1D pattern has one internal freedom, either a signed distance or angle value.



The pattern requires either a direction (linear pattern) or a centre (angular pattern) which is defined by an existing DCM geometry. 
When the reference node is created the g\_node of the defining geometry is specified and this creates an implied constraint between the pattern referencenode and the defining geometry.



The same reference node will be used by all of the pattern constraints in a patterned group of geometries. 
The defining geometry does not need to be fixed, so the direction or centre of the pattern can be a freedom of the model.
- The two geometries that are to be patterned from each other. 
These must be of the same type, or for parametrics offset curves, the second geometry may be a copy curve based on the first geometry.
- A multiplier. 
This is a non-zero integer that defines the relative spacing of the patterned geometries. 
Note that the relative spacing has a forward direction, and the sign of the multiplier is important.
- A pattern constraint is applied between each pair of geometries and the pattern reference node with the offset defined by the multiplier and the patternâ€™s internal freedom.

The pattern value is the distance or angle between patterned geometries with multiplier 1. An initial pattern value can be specified by the application, which can influence the underdefined solving behaviour, but also allow the DCM to calculate whether the pattern is satisfied in its initial configuration without a call to evaluate. 
If this is not specified, then the DCM will instead calculate the pattern value from the model.

For 1D patterns, an application is free to choose how pattern constraints are added between the geometries. 
There are several possible schemes:

- Add pattern constraints between a "master", or reference instance and other instances. 
All instances would have a different absolute value e.g. 
1, 2, 3 etc. 
This method is generally recommended for best performance with patterns.
- Add pattern constraints between adjacent instances of the geometry. 
In this case all multipliers would have the same absolute value e.g. 
1, 1, 1 etc.

Different values of the multipliers can be used to generate a pattern with "gaps".

![fig28_linear_pattern_multipliers.bmp](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Logical constraints_8.png)

Figure 31: Multipliers in a linear pattern

It is possible to add more than one patterned constraint between two instances. 
This allows the application to create a closed regular circular pattern with an equal angle between each instance.

[Figure 32: Regular circular pattern](#_Ref420912133) shows a circular pattern in which each node is referenced to a 'master' instance. 
Starting at the master and going in an anti-clockwise direction, the next group has a multiplier of 1 to the master. 
The next group has a multiplier of 2 to the master, etc. 
The final instance has two patterned constraints and the multipliers of 7 and -1 are defined relative to the master.

![](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Logical constraints_9.png)

Figure 32: Regular circular pattern

Note that closed circular patterns do not require a pattern value constraint, since the internal angular freedom is removed by the additional pattern constraint. 
The absence of a pattern value constraint means that the choice of anti-clockwise direction in this example is arbitrary (and would correspond to a positive pattern value).

This method may be used to create regular polygons by applying pattern constraints to a sequence of points and lines. 
See sections [15.7 Patterns](15.7._Patterns.md)

DCM functions: [add\_pattern](16.3._Defining_the_model_data.md)

Frustum function: [DCM\_pattern\_multiplier](17.2._Basic_dimension_functions.md)

#### 4.3.11.2 2D patterns

Each 2D pattern constraint requires:

- A reference node that represents the pattern. 
This node allows DCM to communicate the status of the pattern as a whole (e.g. 
is it well-defined) and allows the internal freedom to be constrained. 
A 2D pattern has two internal freedoms, two signed distance values.



The pattern requires two existing DCM lines to define the directions. 
When the reference node is created the g\_nodes of the defining geometry is specified, and this creates implied parallel constraints between the pattern referencenode and the defining geometry.



The same reference node will be used by all of the pattern constraints in a patterned group of geometries. 
As with 1D patterns, defining geometry does not need to be fixed, so the directions can be freedoms of the model.
- The two geometries that are to be patterned from each other. 
These must be of the same type.
- Two multipliers corresponding to the two reference node directions. 
This is an integer that defines the relative spacing of the patterned geometries. 
Note that the relative spacing has a forward direction, and the sign of the multiplier is important. 
Note: One multiplier may be zero, but not both.
- A pattern constraint is applied between each pair of geometries and the pattern node with the offset defined by the multipliers and the patternâ€™s internal distance freedoms.

As in the case of 1D patterns, initial pattern values can be specified, to allow the DCM to determine if the model is in an already-solved position. 
If initial pattern values are not specified, then the pattern values will be calculated from the model during a call to evaluate.

For 2D patterns, all pattern constraints associated with a particular 2D pattern must be applied from one "reference" instance of the geometry onto the other instances. 
The instances would have multipliers with different value pairs, e.g. 
(0, 1), (1, 2), (1, -1). For example, [Figure 33: Using a 2D pattern to change a grid of similar elements](#_Ref241554189), shows a simple 2D pattern of profiles. 
The reference geometry is the profile in the bottom left corner, shown in bold. 
Each geometry in the other profiles is constrained to the equivalent geometry in that reference profile. 
For example, all the geometry in the top right corner instance will have multipliers of 3 in the x direction and 2 in the y direction.

The fact that the 2D pattern constraint is added always between the reference and each instance may result in a specific under-defined behaviour, i. 
e. 
the "reference" instance is less likely to be moved by DCM in the absence of other constraints which well-define the position of any of the other instances.

2D patterns can also be used to create 1D linear patterns. 
The application should always return a multiplier "0" for the second reference direction of the 2D pattern and a value 0 for the pattern value of such direction.

### 4.3.12 Equal relative transform constraints

Equal relative transform constraints define that one group of geometry is constrained to be mapped onto an identical group of geometry by a rigid transform. 
This allows an application to implement the concept of Reference and Instance copies of geometry. 
For example, a single reference profile may be defined and also one or more instances of this profile used within a sketch, using relative transforms. 
This ensures that each instance maintains the same shape and size as the reference profile, whatever orientation and position they might have as a result of further constraints.

An equal relative transform constraint is placed between two equivalent geometries and a third g\_node that is a Relative Transform node. 
A relative transform node is a container for a DCM transform. 
Any number of pairs of equivalent geometries may be constrained to a single relative transform node. 
All of these pairs are then constrained to be separated by the same transform.

Thus a profile of edges and points can be constrained to be an instanced copy of a similar profile by placing equal relative transform constraints between each pair of equivalent geometries.

The equal relative transform constraints do not define what the exact transform between the reference and instance is. 
This remains a freedom that can be separately removed by adding any DCM constraints between the geometries involved.

If equal relative transform constraints are applied between fixed geometry, then this will define at least some part of the transform between them, depending on the geometry concerned (a relative transform constraint between fixed points has two of the three freedoms of the transform defined, for example). If the geometries are ellipses or parametrics, then all freedoms will be removed.

Equivalent geometries are either two geometries of the same type, for analytic geometries, or for parametric, spline and offset geometry the second geometry should be a copy curve created from the first.

### 4.3.13 Dependence constraints

A dependence constraint can only be applied between a parametric curve and another geometry (which may be another parametric geometry) or a variable. 
It is used to inform the DCM that the parametric curve depends upon another DCM geometry or variable. 
Two types are supported:

- DCM\_DEPENDENCE â€“ A fully variational dependence constraint. 
The DCM will solve constraints to a region of a curve that is fully dependent by, if necessary, reshaping the curve multiple times in this region to find a shape that satisfies all the constraints.
- DCM\_SIMPLE\_DEPENDENCE â€“ A limited dependence. 
The DCM will solve constraints to a region of a curve defined with simple dependence constraints only if it can determine a sequential solution so that a single reshaping of the region of the curve is necessary. 
This means that some constraint schemes, typically where the curve shape changes as a result of constraints onto the curve, will not be solved, but that evaluation will always be fast.

See chapter [7\. Overview of parametric geometry](7._Overview_of_parametric_geometry.md)

Frustum functions: [DCM\_parametric\_regenerate](17.5._Frustum_functions_for_evaluated_parametrics.md)

### 4.3.14 Equal curve property constraints

Equal curve property constraints may be applied between a parametric curve and another curved geometry or a line, depending on the particular property being constrained. 
It is also possible to apply an equal curve property constraint between two locations on the same parametric curve, making a single geometry constraint. 
The constraints will set a property of the curves to be the same at a particular location on the curve, as defined by a help parameter. 
Where the second geometry is a line or circle, the property is constant for that geometry and therefore no position is required. 
For ellipses, the location of the constraint is defined by a help point.

The following curve property constraints are supported:

- DCM\_EQUAL\_DIRECTION â€“ Sets the tangent directions of the two curves to be the same at a particular location. 
Differs from the simple tangent constraint because the curves are not defined to be touching at this location. 
May be applied between a parametric curve (including splines) or ellipse and another parametric curve, ellipse or a line.
- DCM\_EQUAL\_FIRST\_DERIVATIVE â€“ Sets the first derivative (with respect to the curve parameter) of the two curves to be the same at a particular location. 
May be applied between two parametric curves (including splines) or two positions on the same curve.
- DCM\_EQUAL\_SECOND\_DERIVATIVE \- Sets the second derivative (with respect to the curve parameter) of the two curves to be the same at a particular location. 
May be applied between two parametric curves (including splines) or two positions on the same curve.
- DCM\_EQUAL\_CURVATUREâ€“ Sets the curvature of the two curves to be the same at a particular location. 
May be applied between two parametric curves (including splines) or two positions on the same curve.
- DCM\_EQUAL\_CURVATURE\_DERIVATIVEâ€“ Sets the derivative of the curvature with respect to length to be the same at a particular location. 
This constraint is not currently supported for general parametrics.

The position on the curves at which the constraint acts is defined by the help parameter (for parametric curves) or help point (for ellipses). It is possible to create and fix parameter nodes to define the exact position of the constraint (e.g. 
at the end of a curve).

The concept of alignment is supported for equal curve property constraints. 
For vector quantities (direction, first and second derivatives) the alignment can specify whether the two curve vectors should be parallel or anti-parallel, or simply choose the alignment closest to the initial configuration. 
For scalar quantities (curvature and curvature derivative) the alignment reflects only the sign of the value (positive or negative) where aligned is interpreted as equal sign, and anti-aligned means having opposite signs.

### 4.3.15 Lock constraints

The lock constraint prevents a geometry or set from moving upon evaluation. 
It can be applied to the (whole) geometry or can be used to just prevent the centre or the directon of a geometry from moving.

The effect of applying this constraint is similar to using the function fix, but has significant advantages, as explained in the next section [4.3.15.1 Comparison of locking with fixing](#_Ref474313692). Multiple locks can be assigned to the same geometry or set.

Lock constraints are types of r\_nodes and the following three variants are available:

- DCM\_LOCK\_WHOLE \- prevents an entire geometry or set from moving upon evaluation. 
This is equivalent to using the function fix on the geometry or set, with some advantages as noted below.

Lock whole can be applied to all types of geometries and sets, and it is the only lock constraint that can be applied to a point.
- DCM\_LOCK\_CENTRE \- prevents the centre of a geometry from moving upon evaluation. 
The effect is the same as making the geometry concentric to a fixed point.

Lock centre can only be applied to circles and ellipses.
- DCM\_LOCK\_DIRECTION \- prevents the direction of a geometry or set from changing upon evaluation. 
The effect is the same as adding a parallel constraint between the directed geometry and a fixed line or between a directed geometry in a set and an external fixed line.

Lock direction is compatible with any directed geometry and can be applied directly to an entire set (rigid, scalable, uni- or bi-scalable).

For a set which has rotational symmetry, the lock direction constraint can be used to remove the rigid-body rotational freedom of the set which cannot otherwise be removed without adding construction geometry.

#### 4.3.15.1 Comparison of locking with fixing

The lock constraint is an alternative to fixing the geometry. 
There are certain advantages of locking over fixing:

- Lock constraints will contribute to the number of constraints in the constraint balance.
- Constraints between fixed geometry are ignored by DCM so there is no information provided on whether these constraints are satistifed or not. 
In contrast, DCM will not ignore constraints to locked geometry. 
If the constraints are not satisfied, they will be given a status indicating the failure. 
However, if they are satisfied they will not be "solved", so performance is not significantly affected.
- Fixed geometry always has a status of G\_FIXED - it cannot have a status indicating a problem with the constraint scheme. 
This means that in an over-defined model, there may be no direct indication that the fixing of the geometry is part of the problem. 
With a lock constraint, the geometry will be given the status G\_WELL\_DEFINED or G\_UNDER\_DEFINED if it is solved, but it can have a failure status, such as G\_OVER\_DEFINED if the lock constraint is conflicting with other constraints in the system.
- By design, DCM will allow a fixed geometry to be moved via dragging (dynamic\_evaluate), if it is explicitly given a drag transform. 
However, a lock constraint will always be respected by the DCM in dragging and so a locked geometry will not be moved even if an input transform is supplied.
- Locked and fixed nodes can be moved using move\_and\_evaluate if an explicit transform is specified.



Note that for locked nodes, move\_and\_evaluate is currently not fully supported if only a component of the geometry is locked.

If a geometry is both fixed and has a lock constraint, the geometry will have a G\_FIXED status and the lock constraint will have a D\_BETWEEN\_FIXED status.
