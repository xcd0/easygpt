# 4\. Dimensions and Constraints

This chapter describes all the dimensions and constraints supported and how they are interpreted by the DCM.

Dimensions (distance, angle, radius or curve length) have an associated value whereas constraints (e.g. 
parallel, perpendicular, etc) do not have an associated value. 
The DCM will solve models that have too many constraints provided that they are consistent but will not solve models that have too many dimensions.

The types of dimensions and constraints that can be applied to spline curves are similar to that that can be applied to evaluated parametric curves. 
The following sections only distinguish between these curve types where they differ. 
Otherwise they are both referred to as parametrics.
