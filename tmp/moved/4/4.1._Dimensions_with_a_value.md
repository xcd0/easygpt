## 4.1 Dimensions with a value

Note that although distance and angle dimensions and circle radii can take a value of zero it is usually preferable to use a logical constraint to represent the dimension in this case. 
This is because the DCM will only find solutions that assume the value of a dimension could subsequently be changed, even if it is currently zero.

Zero valued dimensions may also lead to problems with chirality. 
See section [5.5 Models with ambiguous chirality](5.5._Models_with_ambiguous_chirality.md)

### 4.1.1 Dimension values

The value of a dimension can be specified in one of two ways:

- It may be given as a real number that is chosen by the application and can only be changed between calls to the DCM.
- It may be made into a variable. 
Variables can be coupled together with equations. 
The DCM will solve these equations simultaneously with other dimensions and constraints to find the values of the variables. 
See section [2.5 Evaluating the model](2.5._Evaluating_the_model.md)

Frustum function: [DCM\_dimension\_value](17.2._Basic_dimension_functions.md)

### 4.1.2 Distance

This is defined for pairs of geometry of all types. 
Some points to note are:

- The value of a distance dimension can only be negative when half spaces or alignment are defined.
- Line/line \- A distance between two lines implies that they are parallel with the given separation. 
The DCM will treat the two lines as if they had a parallel logical constraint between them.
- Point/point & point/line \- Gives the minimum distance between the point and the geometry.
- Parametric/any geometry \- See chapter [7\. Overview of parametric geometry](7._Overview_of_parametric_geometry.md)
- Circle/any geometry and ellipse/any geometry \- Distance dimensions onto circles and ellipses can be of two types: minimum distance dimensions or dimensions with a help point. 
See the following sections for details of these.

#### 4.1.2.1 Minimum distance dimension

If the geometries do not intersect then the dimension is the minimum distance between them. 
If they do intersect it is the smallest of the possible separation distances. 
This means that it is not possible to dimension across the diameter of a circle. 
For example, the dimensions between the circle and the line in the three configurations shown in [Figure 12: Interpretation of minimum distance dimensions](#_Ref420906513) are the only ones that are allowed by the DCM:

![fig12_min_distance.bmp](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Dimensions with a value.png)

Figure 12: Interpretation of minimum distance dimensions

#### 4.1.2.2 Dimensions with a help point

It is possible to dimension to a specified "side" of a circle or ellipse by providing a help point to the DCM. 
A help point is provided by the application and is used by the DCM for defining which side of the geometry the dimension is measured to. 
Note the help point is not a geometric entity. 
A help point is a position vector that is associated with a dimension and a geometry; hence a circle-line distance dimension can have one help point and a circle-circle distance dimension can have two help points. 
The table below shows when help points can be used.

[Figure 13: Interpretation of distance dimensions with help points](#_Ref420906536) shows the effect of increasing the value of a dimension of this type between a circle and a line (similar configurations are possible for a dimension to an ellipse). The small circles show the positions of the help points.

![fig13_help_points.bmp](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Dimensions with a value_1.png)

Figure 13: Interpretation of distance dimensions with help points

The application needs only to provide an approximate position for the help point. 
The example below shows a distance dimension between a circle and a line and the initial, approximate position of the help point. 
On evaluation, the DCM will move the help point to its accurate position on the circle. 
The application could use the position of this help point for deciding how to draw the dimension leader lines. 
This can be especially useful for dimensions to an ellipse.

![fig14_circle_line.bmp](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Dimensions with a value_2.png)

Figure 14: Help point on a circle-line dimension

Help points may be specified for distance dimensions, tangent, normal constraints and coincidence constraints to circles or ellipses. 
If no help point is specified for a distance dimension the DCM will assume that the dimension is a minimum distance dimension. 
If no help point is specified for a constraint, the DCM will use the nearest solution. 
For some cases (for example, a distance dimension between two circles) it is possible to specify a help point on both geometries. 
In these cases help points should be at both ends, or neither end.

Note that if a circle has a zero radius the help point will not define which side the dimension measures to. 
See section [5.5 Models with ambiguous chirality](5.5._Models_with_ambiguous_chirality.md)

#### 4.1.2.3 Help points and help parameters

Help parameters are used for dimensions and constraints to parametric curves - see chapter [7\. Overview of parametric geometry](7._Overview_of_parametric_geometry.md)
For example, a dimension between a line and a circle can have either one help point or none. 
Similarly, a dimension between a circle and a parametric curve must always have a help parameter, and optionally have a help point.

Table 2: Permitted combinations of help points

Notes:

- (1) Although a help point is optional, one help parameter to the parametric (or offset parametric) must always be used.

- (2) Two help parameters are required.
- (3) It is possible to use a single help point on a dimension between a circle and an ellipse, but this must be placed on the ellipse.
- (4) When constraining pairs of circles using an equal distance constraint, either 0 or 2 help points must be used for each pair of circles. 
It is permitted to use help points on only one pair of circles.
- (5) Dimensions to ellipses can use help parameters, help points or neither. 
An application will first be given the opportunity to use a help parameter, or to specify that help points will be used. 
The following limitations apply:

- Help parameters are required for all dimensions to an ellipse that has curve extensions.
- For dimensions to offset ellipses, applications must use either help parameters or help points.
- For directed distance dimensions, applications must use either help parameters or help points.
- For all other dimensions to an ellipse, help points are not obligatory but it is recommended that they be used.

#### 4.1.2.4 Directed distance dimensions

Normally, a distance dimension measures the minimum distance between the two geometries. 
However, for all geometries except lines it is possible to measure the distance in a particular direction. 
An example of where this facility can be used is to implement horizontal and vertical distance dimensions between points.

The direction of the dimension can be specified either in terms of an absolute vector value, or relative to the direction (perpendicular or parallel) of a line. 
With the latter method the direction of the dimension will change whenever the angle of the line changes.

Note that if a directed distance dimension is used to a circle or ellipse it is necessary to specify a help point. 
Hence, it is not possible to have a minimum distance directed dimension.

Parallel directed distances can be signed (see below) but perpendicular distances cannot.

Starting with version 75.0, an enhanced solving method for directed distances has been introduced and is activated by default. 
The application can revert to the old behavior by setting a global option , see [16.2.6.15 Control solving mode for directed distances](16.2._Configure_global_DCM_behaviour.md)

![fig15_directed_distances.bmp](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Dimensions with a value_3.png)

Figure 15: Examples of directed distance dimensions

Frustum functions: [DCM\_directed\_distance](17.2._Basic_dimension_functions.md)

#### 4.1.2.5 Signed distances and directed distances

For regular distance (and radius) dimensions, the DCM always takes the absolute value of the dimension before computing the solution so that it makes no difference if a dimension value is +1 or -1, for example.

For most distance dimensions, it is possible to use additional controls to make them signed distances. 
This allows an application better control over the solution. 
It reduces the need to pre-position the geometry. 
It also allows the application better control of the behaviour when a dimension has an initial value of zero: For signed distances, the application can predict direction in which a distance will be measured if it is changed to a non-zero value.

Directed distances can be signed if they are measured parallel to the direction being used. 
In that case, the sign relates to the relative order of the two geometries in the direction of measurement which is determined by the alignment of the value with the direction. 
Perpendicular distances cannot be signed.

For other distances the application can specify the side, or half-space, of a geometry on which the dimension should be solved. 
A distance dimension between, for example, a point and a line can be solved in one of two ways: The point must lie on one of two distinct lines either side of that line. 
The 2D DCM considers these two solutions to be distinct chiralities and the default behaviour is that the DCM will give the solution corresponding to the initial starting position of the geometries. 
The DCM will always aim to preserve this initial measured chirality during further solves.

For a signed dimension, the DCM will use the sign of the dimension value when computing the solution to the constraint. 
For a signed distance, the DCM can solve for a continuous range of values from positive to negative.

For more information on signed distances see the definition of the half space in section [5.6 Dimension half space](5.6._Dimension_half_space.md)

Frustum functions: [DCM\_dimension\_half\_space](17.2._Basic_dimension_functions.md)

### 4.1.3 Radius

This is defined only for circles and ellipses. 
For a circle, the radius dimension will give the radius of the circle. 
A radius dimension on a circle can have a value of zero or greater. 
An ellipse can be given two radii. 
One is the major radius and the other is the minor radius and they must both be greater than the current linear resolution. 
There is no requirement that the major radius is greater than the minor radius.

### 4.1.4 Angle

This is defined only between pairs of geometries with a direction and gives the angle in radians between the two directions. 
The angle is measured between the two forward directions, anti-clockwise from the first to the second, and can take any value between 0 and 2π radians. 
If the application returns a value for the angle that is less than 0 or greater than 2π the DCM will automatically bring it into this range.

![fig16_angle_between_two_lines.bmp](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Dimensions with a value_4.png)

Figure 16: Definition of angle between two lines

![fig17_angle_between_ellipses.bmp](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Dimensions with a value_5.png)

Figure 17: Definition of angle between two ellipses

#### 4.1.4.1 Angle dimensions in an application

The DCM definition of an angle dimension allows it to have any value between 0 and 2π radians. 
This definition makes use of the forward direction associated with the geometries.

Commonly, an application will not show the forward direction of, for example, a line and will allow angle dimensions to be placed in any sector between two lines. 
To facilitate this it is necessary for the application to convert between the dimension as displayed to the user, and the dimension given to the DCM. 
A method of doing this is described below.

[Figure 18: Characteristics of the sectors between two crossing lines](#_Ref190077893) shows two crossing lines, line1 and line2, and their forward directions. 
The lines define four minor sectors (that is, sectors less than π radians). Each sector can be distinguished by two criteria. 
These are found as follows:

- Pick the sector of interest.
- Imagine rotating line1 through the sector to line2 (as if the angle reduces to zero).
- Note the direction of this rotation, is it clockwise or anticlockwise?
- At the end of the rotation, line1 is coincident to line2. Determine whether the lines are parallel or antiparallel.

Examples of the four sectors between two lines are labelled in [Figure 18: Characteristics of the sectors between two crossing lines](#_Ref190077893).

![fig18_sectors.bmp](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Dimensions with a value_6.png)

Figure 18: Characteristics of the sectors between two crossing lines

In the DCM, an angle dimension is always computed as though it is in the parallel/anticlockwise sector. 
Before giving the value of the angle dimension to the DCM, the application needs to modify the value of the measured angle according to which of the four sectors the angle is measured in.

The following lists the angle to give to the DCM when the measured angle is ang.

- Parallel/anticlockwise sector: ang
- Antiparallel/clockwise sector: π \- ang
- Parallel/clockwise sector: 2π \- ang
- Antiparallel/anticlockwise sector: π \+ ang

The same technique is used when the angle is in a major sector (i.e., where the value of the measured angle is greater than π). For example, [Figure 19: Characteristics of the sectors between two bounded lines](#_Ref190077934) shows examples of how the sectors between two lines are classified for two bounded lines.

![fig19_sectors.bmp](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Dimensions with a value_7.png)

Figure 19: Characteristics of the sectors between two bounded lines

In the example on the left, the lines are positioned such that the minor angle is already in the sector expected by DCM, so no adjustment is needed. 
If the application requires the major angle, then the value must be converted using the rule for "parallel-clockwise".

In the example on the right, the first line is reversed, so that in this case the DCM angle is measuring from the extension of line 1 to line 2. In this case, both angles between the bounded portions of the lines must be converted.

### 4.1.5 Arc length

An arc length dimension constrains the length of a circular arc. 
This is defined as the distance along the perimeter of the circle between the start point and the end point, travelling in an anti-clockwise direction.

The arc length dimension is a dimension with a value that acts upon three geometries: A circle and two points that define a bounded arc. 
The DCM requires that the end-points are separately constrained to be coincident to the circle in order to solve the arc length. 
This may be through using a coincident constraint or by fixing the point and the circle or placing them in the same set.

Assuming there are sufficient freedoms within the model, the DCM can solve for the arc length by varying the positions of the points and changing the radius of the circle.

The order of the points is significant, since it defines segment of the whole circle which forms the arc. 
Arc length dimensions are always signed, with a positive direction corresponding to the anticlockwise direction around the circle, which matches the DCM angle definition.

The dimension will ensure that the portion of the perimeter of the circle enclosed by the two points is equal to the dimension value. 
The DCM may solve an arc length by wrapping the arc around the circle so that the length is greater than a single perimeter. 
This is known as winding.

Note that the arc length dimension does not provide a means to restrict the angle subtended by an arc. 
The DCM may solve the model in such a way that the arc wraps around the circle so that the angle subtended by the arc is more than 2π (360 degrees).

![fig20_arc_length.bmp](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Dimensions with a value_8.png)

Figure 20: Arc length and winding angle

Arc length dimensions support variable dimensions, which means that they can be added to DCM equations, or used simply as a reference dimension for measurement only.

Note that the following limitations apply:

- Rigid arc length dimensions are not fully supported. 
By default, DCM will enquire whether an arc length is rigid but not use that information to allow over-constrained but consistent cases with the value. 
An option exists to disable this enquiry (giving the behaviour from versions 71 and earlier) or to attempt to enable full OCC processing (which is currently not supported).
- Arc length dimensions are not supported where the circle is in a scalable set.

For under-defined models, the DCM may choose to vary either the radius or the positions of points to find the solution. 
The transform bias functionality can be used to influence which geometry is moved.

Frustum functions: [DCM\_winding\_angle\_start\_value](17.2._Basic_dimension_functions.md)

#### 4.1.5.1 Winding angle and winding number

The DCM only recognises the concept of an arc within the context of an arc length constraint. 
Unless the 3 constraints of coincident end-points and an arc length dimension are present, then DCM only knows that there are points and whole circles within the model.

In DCM terms, an arc may encompass any number of complete circumferences of the circle. 
The number of complete circles that are incorporated into the arc may be termed the winding number. 
The winding number is essentially the modulus of the winding angle for which the arc length constraint has been solved. 
So an arc of value 5π is equivalent to a winding number of 2, whilst a value of -3π equates to a winding number of 1 (measured in the reverse direction).

The application may specify the required winding angle through the frustum. 
This acts as a guide for the number of times that the arc length may wrap around the circle in the desired solution, and allows for greater control of the solution. 
The angle value is used rather than a number in order to ensure continuity of solutions and to avoid unwanted jumps.

For example, if the radius of the underlying circle is not constrained, and the required arc length is greater than the current circle circumference, the radius may increase during solving. 
This would result in a subtended angle less than 2π. This may be important when considering the start positions of gears and similar mechanisms.

Note that the winding angle is a rough guide to the desired solution but it does not force the DCM to solve for any particular winding number. 
Depending on the other inputs to a model, the DCM may wrap the arc around the circle multiple times to find a solution.

### 4.1.6 Curve length

A curve length dimension can be used to constrain the length of an ellipse, an evaluated parametric curve, a conic, or a spline. 
The dimension can be either the full length of the curve, or it can measure a portion of the curve. 
In all cases, the ends of the dimension are given as parameters on the curve. 
Note to constrain the length of an ellipse, the application must specify help parameters for the dimension – see section [4.1.2.3 Help points and help parameters](#_Ref90359680).

The dimension is measured from the first to the second dimension parameters. 
The curve length is a signed value, and if it is negative then the first parameter is less than the second. 
The figure below show two curve length dimensions on an ellipse (which is parameterised anti-clockwise).

![fig21_curve_length.bmp](../Resources/Images/2ddcm_manual/Dimensions with a value_9.png)

Figure 21: Curve length dimensions on an ellipse

To dimension the full length of an open curve it is possible to use fixed p\_nodes at the start and end of the curve (see section [7.2.6 Curve length dimension](7.2._Dimensions_and_constraints_to_parametric_curves.md)

Note that on a periodic curve the dimension can "wrap around" several times.

### 4.1.7 Pattern value

This class of dimension allows the internal freedoms of 1D or 2D patterns to be removed. 
The pattern value may be a distance or an angle, depending on the pattern type (see section [4.3.11 Pattern constraints](4.3._Logical_constraints.md)

Pattern value dimensions are always signed quantities, so the DCM will take account of the sign of the value provided by the application. 
For linear patterns, a positive pattern value corresponds to instances being patterned in a direction aligned with the reference geometry (for positive pattern multipliers). For circular patterns, a positive pattern value corresponds to instances being patterned in an anti-clockwise direction (for positive pattern multipliers).
